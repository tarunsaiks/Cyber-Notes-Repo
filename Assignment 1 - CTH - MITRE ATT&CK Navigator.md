- **Identify and create a layer** for **Group 2**, highlighting its known attack techniques.  
- **Merge these two layers** into a single layer to visualize all techniques together.  

---

### **3. Scoring the Techniques**  
- Develop a **scoring system** to evaluate the **severity** or **frequency** of each attack technique.  
- Example scoring criteria (scale of 1-5):  
  - **Impact** (High = 5, Low = 1)  
  - **Ease of Execution** (Easier = Higher score)  
  - **Detection Difficulty** (Harder to detect = Higher score)  
- Apply your **scoring system** to the **merged layer** in MITRE ATT&CK Navigator.  

---

### **4. Deliverables**  
- **Screenshot** of the merged layer in **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator**.  
- A **short report (1-2 pages)** explaining:  
  - The **key attack techniques** used by each group.  
  - **Differences and similarities** between these groups.  
  - Your **chosen scoring methodology** and justification.  
  - A **brief discussion** on how understanding APT groups enhances cybersecurity defenses.

# **MITRE ATT&CK Framework Analysis: APT Group Comparison**

## **1. Introduction**  
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups pose significant cybersecurity risks to organizations worldwide. This report analyzes and compares the attack techniques of **two well-known APT groups** using the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework. The objective is to identify their **tactics, techniques, and tools**, visualize them using **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator**, and assign a **scoring system** to evaluate the severity and frequency of their attack techniques.

---

## **2. APT Group Identification**  

Based on research and provided hints, the APT groups analyzed in this report are:  

### **Group 1: APT29 (Cozy Bear)**  
- **State-sponsored** cyber-espionage group linked to **Russia**.  
- Targets **government entities, military organizations, and the defense sector**.  
- **Common Techniques:**  
  - **Spear Phishing (T1566.001)** â€“ Delivering malicious attachments or links.  
  - ==**Phishing for information (T1598)**== -  send phishing messages to elicit sensitive information that can be used during targeting
  - **Credential Dumping (T1003)** â€“ Extracting stored credentials for lateral movement.  
  - **Exploiting Public-Facing Applications (T1190)** â€“ Leveraging vulnerabilities in exposed systems.  
  - ==**Network Denial of Service (T1498)**== â€“ Impacting service availability.  

### **Group 2: APT41 (Winnti Group)**  
- **Highly versatile** group conducting **espionage and financially motivated attacks**.  
- Known for **supply chain compromises, ransomware, and sophisticated malware**.  
- **Common Techniques:**  
  - **Supply Chain Compromise (T1195)** â€“ Injecting malicious code into trusted software.  
  - **Ransomware Deployment (T1486)** â€“ Encrypting victim data for extortion.  
  - ==**Search Victim-Owned Websites (T1596)**== â€“ Reconnaissance for publicly available data.  
  - ==**Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486)**== â€“ Causing financial and operational disruption.

## **4. Scoring Methodology**  

A scoring system was developed to **quantify the impact and severity** of attack techniques:  

| **Criteria** | **Description** | **Scale (1-5)** |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Impact** | How damaging is the technique? | 1 (Low) - 5 (High) |
| **Ease of Execution** | How easily can an attacker execute it? | 1 (Difficult) - 5 (Easy) |
| **Detection Difficulty** | How hard is it to detect? | 1 (Easy) - 5 (Hard) |

### **Scoring Example**  
| **Technique** | **Impact** | **Ease of Execution** | **Detection Difficulty** | **Total Score** |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Spear Phishing (T1566.001) | 5 | 4 | 4 | 13 |
| Credential Dumping (T1003) | 4 | 3 | 5 | 12 |
| Exploiting Public-Facing Apps (T1190) | 5 | 5 | 3 | 13 |
| Ransomware (T1486) | 5 | 4 | 5 | 14 |

These scores were applied in **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator** to prioritize **high-risk techniques**.
