Splunk search language is built by 5 components

- Search Terms - Foundations of Search Queries
- Commands - Tells what we want to do with those search results (creating charts, computing statistics and formatting)
- Functions - Explain how we want to chart, compute and evaluate the results.
- Arguments - Variables we apply to the function (product_name)
- Clauses - Explains how we want results grouped or defined.
