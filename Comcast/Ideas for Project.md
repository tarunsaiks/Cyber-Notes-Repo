# Threat Hunting Portfolio Research Project Ideas

## ~~!1. Malicious File Analysis~~:
~~- **Idea:** Analyze and hunt for malicious files within a simulated environment.
- ~~**Technologies/Tools:** YARA rules, VirusTotal, Wireshark, IDA Pro, Cuckoo Sandbox.~~

## 2. Anomalous Network Traffic Detection:
- **Idea:** Identify abnormal network behavior or traffic patterns that may indicate a security threat.
- **Technologies/Tools:** **Bro (Zeek)**, Suricata, Wireshark, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

## 3. Endpoint Anomaly Detection:
- **Idea:** Hunt for unusual activities or anomalies on endpoints that may indicate compromise.
- **Technologies/Tools:** Sysmon, Osquery, Windows Event Logs, Elastic Security, Carbon Black.

## 4. Threat Intelligence Integration:
- **Idea:** Incorporate threat intelligence feeds into your threat hunting process.
- **Technologies/Tools:** MISP, STIX/TAXI, ThreatConnect, ThreatQuotient, OpenCTI.

## 5. Cloud Security Threat Hunting:
- **Idea:** Extend threat hunting to cloud environments, identifying security threats in AWS, Azure, or GCP.
- **Technologies/Tools:** AWS CloudTrail, Azure Security Center, Google Cloud Security Command Center.
