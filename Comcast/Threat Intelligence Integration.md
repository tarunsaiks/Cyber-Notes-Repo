## Idea:
Incorporate threat intelligence feeds into your threat hunting process to enhance the detection capabilities and proactive nature of your cybersecurity strategy. Threat intelligence provides valuable information about known threats, indicators of compromise (IoCs), and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of adversaries.

## Technologies/Tools:

### MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform & Threat Sharing):
[MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/) is an open-source threat intelligence platform designed to improve the sharing of structured threat information. It allows for the creation, sharing, and correlation of threat intelligence data, making it a valuable tool for collaborative threat hunting.

### STIX/TAXI (Structured Threat Information eXpression / Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information):
[STIX](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/) is a standardized language for describing and sharing threat intelligence. [TAXI](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/) is a transport mechanism for sharing STIX-formatted threat intelligence. These standards facilitate interoperability and information sharing between different cybersecurity tools and platforms.

### ThreatConnect:
[ThreatConnect](https://www.threatconnect.com/) is a widely-used threat intelligence platform that allows organizations to aggregate, analyze, and act upon threat data. It provides a central hub for managing and correlating threat intelligence feeds, enabling better-informed decision-making during threat hunting activities.

### ThreatQuotient:
[ThreatQuotient](https://www.threatquotient.com/) is a threat intelligence platform that focuses on aggregating, correlating, and prioritizing threat intelligence. It provides tools for understanding the relevance of threat data to your organization and automating workflows to streamline the threat hunting process.

### OpenCTI (Open Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform):
[OpenCTI](https://www.opencti.io/) is an open-source platform designed to manage threat intelligence data and correlate it with internal data sources. It provides a collaborative environment for analysts to work together, ensuring a more comprehensive understanding of the threat landscape.

## Benefits:
- **Enhanced Detection:** Integration of threat intelligence feeds improves the ability to detect known threats promptly.
- **Contextual Understanding:** Access to threat intelligence provides context around potential threats, helping analysts make informed decisions.
- **Proactive Defense:** By leveraging threat intelligence, organizations can proactively defend against emerging threats before they become widespread.

Remember to document your integration process, the sources of threat intelligence used, and any notable findings or improvements in threat detection achieved through this integration.
