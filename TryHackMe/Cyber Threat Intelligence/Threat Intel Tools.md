## Objectives
- Understanding the basics of threat intelligence & its classifications.
- Using UrlScan.io to scan for malicious URLs.
- Using Abuse.ch to track malware and botnet indicators.
- Investigate phishing emails using PhishTool
- Using Cisco's Talos Intelligence platform for intel gathering.

# URLScan.io

When a URL is submitted, the information recorded includes the domains and IP addresses contacted, resources requested from the domains, a snapshot of the web page, technologies utilised and other metadata about the website.

The site provides two views, the first one showing the most recent scans performed and the second one showing current live scans.

# Abuse.ch\
[Abuse.ch](https://abuse.ch/) is a research project hosted by the Institue for Cybersecurity and Engineering at the Bern University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland. It was developed to identify and track malware and botnets through several operational platforms developed under the project. These platforms are:

- **[Malware Bazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/):**  A resource for sharing malware samples.
- **[Feodo Tracker](https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/):**  A resource used to track botnet command and control (C2) infrastructure linked with Emotet, Dridex and TrickBot.
- **[SSL Blacklist](https://sslbl.abuse.ch/):**  A resource for collecting and providing a blocklist for malicious SSL certificates and JA3/JA3s fingerprints.
- **[URL Haus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/):**  A resource for sharing malware distribution sites.
- **[Threat Fox](https://threatfox.abuse.ch/):**  A resource for sharing indicators of compromise (IOCs).

# PhishTool

[PhishTool](https://www.phishtool.com/) is mainly used for email analysis, it seeks to elevate the perception of phishing as a severe form of attack and provide a responsive means of email security. Through email analysis, security analysts can uncover email IOCs, prevent breaches and provide forensic reports that could be used in phishing containment and training engagements.

Email phishing is one of the main precursors of any cyber attack. Unsuspecting users get duped into opening and accessing malicious files and links sent to them by email, as they appear to be legitimate. As a result, adversaries infect their victims’ systems with malware, harvesting their credentials and personal data and performing other actions such as financial fraud or conducting ransomware attacks.
