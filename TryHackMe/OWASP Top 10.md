## Broken Access Control

In simple words,  only the site's admin user should be able to access a page to manage other users. If a website visitor can access protected pages they are not meant to see, then the access controls are broken.

A regular visitor being able to access protected pages can lead to the following:

- Being able to view sensitive information from other users
- Accessing unauthorized functionality

Simply put, broken access control allows attackers to bypassÂ **authorization**, allowing them to view sensitive data or perform tasks they aren't supposed to.
