Open redirects happen when the web application takes an untrusted input and redirects a user from web application to untrusted site or resources that will be used further for malicious purposes.

> **Impact** : Usually Low, Unless using it to escalating other vulnerabilities

For example, suppose Google had utilized the following URL to redirect users to Gmail:
```URL
https://www.google.com? redirect_to=https://www.gmail.com

https://example.com/login/?nextPage=https://google.com (==Allowed==)

https://example.com/login/?nextPage=https://evilsite.com (==Not Allowed==)
```
