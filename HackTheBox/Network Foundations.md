# Introduction to Networks
## What is Network

Collection of inter-connected devices

Nodes - individual devices
Links - Communication pathways that connect nodes (wired or wireless)
Data Sharing - main objective and purpose of network

## Why Networks are Important?

- Resource sharing
- Communication
- Data Access overcoming physical presence limitations
- Collaboration - people around the world can collaborate and work without physically being there.

## Types of Networks

### LAN

- Covers small area
- owned by single person or organization
- high data transfer
- uses wired or wireless connections
- in-expensive

### WAN

- Covers Cities, countries or continents
- collectively owned or distributed ownership (ISP)

- uses fiber optics, underwater sea cables, satellites and leased telecommunication lines.
- costly and complex

## LAN and WAN Work together, but How??

LAN in Asia can connect to WAN and LAN in America can also connect to WAN. establishing connections, INTERNET.

A home LAN connects to an Internet Service Provider's (ISP) WAN, granting internet access to all devices within the home network. A modem bridges the connection, converting digital signals into suitable formats for transmission over various media. In business settings, WANs enable unified communication and collaboration across different locations, enhancing productivity. At home, devices connect to a router, managing local traffic and communicating with the ISP's WAN, allowing access to global content and services beyond the local network.
