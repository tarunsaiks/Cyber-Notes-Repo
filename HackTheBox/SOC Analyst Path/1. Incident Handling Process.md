Incident handling (IH) has become an important part of an organization's defensive capability against cybercrime. While protective measures are constantly being implemented to **prevent or lower the amount of security incidents**, an incident handling capability is undeniably a necessity for any organization that cannot afford a compromise of its data **confidentiality, integrity, or availability**.

### Incident vs Event
Action occurring in a system or network. Incident is an event with a negative consequence.
We define an IT security incident as an event with a clear intent to cause harm that is performed against a computer system. Examples of incidents are:

- Data theft
- Funds theft
- Unauthorized access to data
- Installation and usage of malware and remote access tools

### Incident Handling
Incident handling is a clearly defined set of procedures to manage and respond to security incidents in a computer or network environment.

## Cyber Kill Chain

The attack lifecycle, describes how attacks manifest, thus understanding this will provide us the valuable insights on how far in the network an attacker is and what they may have access to.

### Recon
- First stage of kill chain.
- attacker chooses target and performs information gathering to be more familiar and gather useful data about target.
- passive information gathering in LinkedIn, instagram, documentations on target web sites if any.
- Job posts usually give out more information on target organization and tech stack used.

### Weaponize
- malware for initial access is developed and embedded into deliverable payload.
- usually malware crafted to be light weight and undetectable by AV and detection tools.
- on large scale, usually purpose on this initial access phase is to provide remote access to target machine in target environment.
### Delivery
- exploit or payload is delivered to the victim.
- traditional approaches like phishing email containing malicious attachment or link to web page.
- Web page could contain either malware or hosting malicious payload to avoid sending it through email scanning tools employed in target organizations.
- Vishing
- Â It is extremely rare to deliver a payload that requires the victim to do more than double-click an executable file or a script (in Windows environments, this can be .bat, .cmd, .vbs, .js, .hta and other formats). 
- Finally, there are cases where physical interaction is utilized to deliver the payload via USB tokens and similar storage tools, that are purposely left around, usually in parking lots and public places.
### Exploitation 
- moment when an exploit is triggered.
- attacker executes code in target system in order to gain access or control.
### Installation
- the initial stager is executed and is running on the compromised machine.
-   few techniques:
	- Droppers: small piece of code that is designed to install malware and execute it, delivered through various means like email attachments, malicious websites, or social engineering tactics.
	- Backdoors: designed to provide attacker with ongoing process to compromised system. often delivered through dropper.
	- Rootkits: designed to hide its presence, often used to evade detection by antivirus.
