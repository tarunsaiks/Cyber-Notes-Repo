Incident handling (IH) has become an important part of an organization's defensive capability against cybercrime. While protective measures are constantly being implemented to **prevent or lower the amount of security incidents**, an incident handling capability is undeniably a necessity for any organization that cannot afford a compromise of its data **confidentiality, integrity, or availability**.

### Incident vs Event
Action occurring in a system or network. Incident is an event with a negative consequence.

- Data theft
- Funds theft
- Unauthorized access to data
- Installation and usage of malware and remote access tools
