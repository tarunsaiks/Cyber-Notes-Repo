Incident handling (IH) has become an important part of an organization's defensive capability against cybercrime. While protective measures are constantly being implemented to **prevent or lower the amount of security incidents**, an incident handling capability is undeniably a necessity for any organization that cannot afford a compromise of its data **confidentiality, integrity, or availability**.

### Incident vs Event

Action occurring in a system or network. Incident is an event with a negative consequence.
We define an IT security incident as an event with a clear intent to cause harm that is performed against a computer system. Examples of incidents are:

- Data theft
- Funds theft
- Unauthorized access to data
- Installation and usage of malware and remote access tools

### Incident Handling

Incident handling is a clearly defined set of procedures to manage and respond to security incidents in a computer or network environment.

[NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf)

## Cyber Kill Chain

The attack lifecycle, describes how attacks manifest, thus understanding this will provide us the valuable insights on how far in the network an attacker is and what they may have access to.
![](../../Pasted%20image%2020250104173745.png)

### Recon

- First stage of kill chain.
- attacker chooses target and performs information gathering to be more familiar and gather useful data about target.
- passive information gathering in LinkedIn, instagram, documentations on target web sites if any.
- Job posts usually give out more information on target organization and tech stack used.

### Weaponize

- malware for initial access is developed and embedded into deliverable payload.
- usually malware crafted to be light weight and undetectable by AV and detection tools.
- on large scale, usually purpose on this initial access phase is to provide remote access to target machine in target environment.

### Delivery

- exploit or payload is delivered to the victim.
- traditional approaches like phishing email containing malicious attachment or link to web page.
- Web page could contain either malware or hosting malicious payload to avoid sending it through email scanning tools employed in target organizations.
- Vishing
- It is extremely rare to deliver a payload that requires the victim to do more than double-click an executable file or a script (in Windows environments, this can be .bat, .cmd, .vbs, .js, .hta and other formats).
- Finally, there are cases where physical interaction is utilized to deliver the payload via USB tokens and similar storage tools, that are purposely left around, usually in parking lots and public places.

### Exploitation

- moment when an exploit is triggered.
- attacker executes code in target system in order to gain access or control.

### Installation

- the initial stager is executed and is running on the compromised machine.
- few techniques:
  - Droppers: small piece of code that is designed to install malware and execute it, delivered through various means like email attachments, malicious websites, or social engineering tactics.
  - Backdoors: designed to provide attacker with ongoing process to compromised system. often delivered through dropper.
  - Rootkits: designed to hide its presence, often used to evade detection by antivirus.

### Command and Control

In the `command and control` stage,

- the attacker establishes a remote access capability to the compromised machine.
- advanced groups will utilize separate tools in order to ensure that multiple variants of their malware live in a compromised network, and if one of them gets discovered and contained, they still have the means to return to the environment.

### Action

- `action` or objective of the attack, it can vary.
- Some adversaries may go after exfiltrating confidential data, while others may want to obtain the highest level of access possible within a network to deploy ransomware.
- Ransomware is a type of malware that will render all data stored on endpoint devices and servers unusable or inaccessible unless a ransom is paid within a limited timeframe (not recommended to pay).

It is important to understand that adversaries won't operate in a linear manner (like the cyber kill chain shows). Some previous cyber kill chain stages will be repeated over and over again. If we take, for example, the `installation` stage of a successful compromise, the logical next step for an adversary going forward is to initiate the `recon` stage again to identify additional targets and find vulnerabilities to exploit, so that he moves deeper into the network and eventually achieves the attack's objective(s).

Our objective is to `stop an attacker from progressing further up the kill chain`, ideally in one of the earliest stages.

# Preparation

Preparation phase mainly has two phases

- establish incident handling capability within organization.
- ability to protect against and prevent IT security incidents by implementing security measures.
- Protective measures include but not limited to:
  - Endpoint hardening
  - Server Hardening
  - Active Directory Tiering
  - Multi Factor Authentication
  - Privileged Access Management

## Preparation pre-requisites

During prep phase, we need to always ensure:

- Skilled Incident Handling Team
- Trained workforce
- Clear Policies and documentations
- Tools (software and hardware)

## Clear Policies and Documentation

Written policies and documentation should contain up-to-date information of following:

1. Incident Response Policy
2. Incident Response Plan and Procedures
3. Roles, Responsibilities and Contact Information of IRT (Incident Response Team)
4. Contact information of necessary stakeholders (legal, management, IT support, communications teams, ISP's, facilities, third-party stakeholders).
5. Baselines of systems and networks out of golden image and clean state environment.
6. Network Diagrams and Topologies.
7. Organization wide asset management database.
8. User accounts with privileged access that can be used on-demand by team when necessary. These user accounts are normally enabled when an incident is confirmed during the initial investigation and then disabled once it is over. A mandatory password reset is also performed when disabling the users.
9. Ability to acquire hardware, software, or an external resource without a complete procurement process (urgent purchase of up to a certain amount).
10. Forensic/Investigative cheat sheets handy to assist during the investigation.

Few cases may require law enforcement notification and external communication to customers and third-party vendors, especially in cases of legal concerns arising from the incident.

For example, a data breach involving customer data has to be reported to law enforcement within a certain time threshold in accordance with GDPR.

There may be many compliance requirements depending on the law, location and/or branches where the incident has occurred, so the best way to understand these is to discuss them with our legal and compliance teams on a per-incident basis (or proactively).

While maintaining documentation is vital, it is also important to document the incident as we investigate. During this phase, we will also establish effective reporting capability.

Incidents can at times be stressful, so it becomes easy to forget the crucial/minor details as we try to resolve the incident.

## Tools (Software and Hardware)

Few of the tools but not limited to:

1. Forensic Workstation for each incident handling team member.
2. Digital Forensic image acquisition and analysis tool.
3. Memory capture and analysis tool.
4. Live response capture tool.
5. Log Analysis tool 
6. Network Capture tool
7. Spare network cables, switches, routers etc.,
8. Write Blockers
9. Hard drives for forensic imaging
10. Power Cables
11. Toolkit
12. IoC creator and ability to search for IoC's
13. Chain of custody forms
14. encryption software
15. Ticket tracking systems
16. Secure facility for storage and investigation
17. Incident handling system independent of organization's system.

> A Jump Bag usually contains most of the tools ready with necessary tools to be picked up and leave immediately.


It is highly important to consider below things:
1. Maintain proper documentation completely independent from organization.
2. Assume the worst from the beginning.
3. Communications about an incident should be conducted through channels that are not part of the organization's systems.

## Protective Measures
### DMARC
- e-mail protection against phishing built on top of existing `SPF` and `DKIM`.
- The idea behind DMARC is to reject emails that **pretend** to originate from your organization. 
- If an adversary is spoofing an email pretending to be an employee asking for an invoice to be paid, the system **will reject** the email before it reaches the intended recipient.
- easy to implement, inexpensive but with mandatory thorough testing.
- If it blocks legitimate emails, we have no ability to recover them.

If email filtering rules are applied on top of `DMARC`, it provides additional protection against emails failing `DMARC`. Because some email systems will perform a DMARC check and include a header stating whether DMARC passed or failed in the message headers.

> [!info]
> While this can be incredibly powerful to detect phishing emails from any domain, it requires extensive testing before it can be introduced in a production environment. 
> 
> High false-positives here are emails that are sent 'on behalf of' via some email sending service, since they tend to fail DMARC due to domain mismatch.

### Endpoint Hardening (& EDR)

Most of the attacks on a daily basis have endpoint devices like workstations and laptops.

Most threats originate from Internet and will target users who are browsing websites, opening attachments or running malicious executables, a part of these events occur from their corporate endpoints.

Few widely recognized endpoint hardening standards include CIS and Microsoft baselines. These can be our building blocks for our organizations hardening baselines. Few highly important actions to note are:

- Disable LLMNR/NetBIOS
- Implement LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution) and remove administrative privileges from regular users.
- Disable or configure PowerShell in `ConstrainedLanguage` mode. PowerShell's `ConstrainedLanguage` mode restricts the capabilities of the language to prevent malicious use.
- Enable Attack Surface Reduction rules if using Microsoft Defender.
- Implement whitelisting at least blocking execution from user-writable folders (Downloads, Desktop, AppData, etc.). 

>[!info] 
>These are the locations where exploits and malicious payloads will initially find themselves. Remember to also block script types such as .hta, .vbs, .cmd, .bat, .js, and similar. 

>[!faq]- Living Off the Land Attacks?
>Please pay attention to [LOLBin](https://lolbas-project.github.io/) files while implementing whitelisting. Do not overlook them; they are really used in the wild as initial access to bypass whitelisting.

## Network Protection

Segmentation is a powerful technique to avoid breaches or attackers spread across the entire network. Business critical systems and sensitive files stored machines should always be isolated and connections must be allowed as per authentication and authorization if required. Internal resources should not be facing internet directly, unless placed in DMZ.

> [!NOTE] DMZ goals and working
> A DMZ  or demilitarized zone is a perimeter network that protects and adds an extra layer of security to an organization’s internal local-area network from untrusted traffic.
> 
> The end goal of a demilitarized zone network is to allow an organization to access untrusted networks, such as the internet, while ensuring its private network or LAN remains secure.
>
>Businesses with a public website that customers use must make their web server accessible to the internet. To protect the corporate local area network, the web server is installed on a separate computer from internal resources. The DMZ enables communication between protected business resources, like internal databases, and qualified traffic from the Internet.


Additionally, we should consider implementing IDS/IPS systems. Particularly when implemented along with SSL/TLS, they can identify malicious traffic based on content (traditional way, not so efficient) and/or on IP reputation or threat intel.

Ensure that only organization approved devices are connected to network, may be some strong policies and controls on security controls. Solutions like 802.1x can be utilized to reduce BYOD or malicious devices connected to network. 

If cloud-only, if using Active Directory, conditional access policies could be implemented to configure access from devices only from company managed devices.

## Privileged Identity Management / MFA / Passwords

Stealing user creds is lately most common escalation path, thanks to PAM tools, that make it hard, but still possible. 

Common mistake is admins either have weak password or shared password with regular user account (non-admin) accounts which are more susceptible to be compromised.

Typical password complexities for a strong password includes
- Uppercase A-Z
- lowercase a-z
- numerical 0-9
- special characters (`!@#$%^&*`)
but it shouldn't be part of any password lists, as they are easily predicted or brute-forced. That's where Passphrases come in. for example - `i D^ck!nG |0Ve CoFFee H0t`

MFA is another identity-protecting solution that at least needs to implemented for any privileged accounts which has administrative access to all applications and devices.

## Vulnerability Scanning
Good old Vulnerability scanning and patch management. prioritize `High` and `Critical` discovered, scans could be automated, but the fixes require manual involvement mostly. if patches couldn't be applied on time, then we got to segment those which are vulnerable.

## User Awareness Trainings
As usual, we need to train users to recognize suspicious behavior and report it when discovered. It doesn't guarantee success, these trainings are known to reduce compromises down the line. Periodic surprise testing could be part of this trainings like monthly phishing test emails, dropped USB sticks in office building etc.,

## Active Directory Security Assessment
Best way to detect security misconfigurations or exposed critical vulnerabilities is with a perspective of an attacker. These security reviews could be internal or out-sourced to third parties will ensure if an endpoint is compromised, the attacker will not have a escalation chances to network. 

Active Directory contains several known and unique escalation paths and bugs, with new ones frequently being discovered. Conducting Active Directory security assessments is essential for maintaining the overall security posture of your environment. It’s important not to assume that your system administrators are aware of all discovered or published bugs, as they likely are not.

## Purple Team Exercises
Training and engaging incident handlers is essential, and the best place to do this is within an organization’s own environment. Purple team exercises involve security assessments by a red team that continuously or eventually informs the blue team about their actions, findings, and any visibility or security shortcomings.

These exercises help identify vulnerabilities in an organization while testing the blue team’s defensive capabilities in logging, monitoring, detection, and responsiveness. If a threat goes unnoticed, it presents an opportunity for improvement. For detected threats, the blue team can test playbooks and incident handling procedures to ensure they are robust and achieve the expected results.


# Detection and Analysis

At this point, we have clear policies, procedures, tools and guidelines to act if any security incidents. Now, we work with `Detection and Analysis` stage involves all aspects of 
- detecting an incident, such as utilizing sensors, logs, and trained personnel. 
-  information and knowledge sharing, as well as utilizing context-based threat intelligence.
- Segmentation of the architecture and having a clear understanding of and visibility within the network are also important factors.

It is always important to understand the attack vectors and their detection from various sources. For example:
- An employee alerting about an abnormal behavior.
- An alert generated from one of our security tools (EDR, SIEM, Firewalls, IDS etc.,)
- Threat Hunting activities (**Now, here I am curious and excited to learn**)
- A third-party notification informing us about their insights on breach or alert.

So, to face this scenarios, we always need to create multiple detection levels by logically categorizing from our network to application level
- Detection at network perimeter using firewalls, IDS/IPS and DMZ.
- Detection at the internal network using local firewalls, HIDS/HIPS etc.,
- Detection at endpoint level using AV, EDR etc.,
- Detection at application level using application logs, service logs.
