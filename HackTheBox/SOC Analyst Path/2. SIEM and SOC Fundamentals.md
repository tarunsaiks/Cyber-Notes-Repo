# What is SIEM? lol
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- merge the management of security data with the supervision of security events.
- theseÂ facilitate real-time evaluations of alerts related to security, which are produced by network hardware and applications.
- SIEM tools possess an extensive range of core functionalities, such as the collection and administration of log events, the capacity to examine log events and supplementary data from various sources, as well as operational features like incident handling, visual summaries, and documentation.
- SIEM systems function by gathering data from a variety of sources, including PCs, network devices, servers, and more. This data is then standardized and consolidated to facilitate ease of analysis.
- SIEM systems generate a vast number of alerts owing to the substantial volume of events produced for each monitored platform.
- Alerts notify Security teams that they must look into a (possible) security event or incident.

# SIEM Business Requirements & Use Cases

### Log Aggregation & Normalization
Log consolidation entails gathering terabytes of security information from vital firewalls, confidential databases, and essential applications.

Utilizing SIEM log consolidation, the SOC team can identify and scrutinize security incidents and events throughout the organization's IT infrastructure. 

By centralizing and correlating information from various sources, SIEM delivers a holistic strategy for threat detection and handling.

This approach allows organizations to recognize patterns, tendencies, and irregularities that could suggest potential security hazards.

### Threat Alerting
A SIEM solution that can identify and alert teams about possible threats by analyzing the vast amount of information collected by SIEM is a huge win and critical to ensure IT security.

Advanced analytics and threat intelligence are used by SIEM solutions to recognize potential threats and generate real-time alerts.

### Data Flows within a SIEM

- SIEM solutions **ingest logs** from various data sources. Each SIEM tool possesses unique capabilities for collecting logs from different sources. This process is known as data ingestion or data collection.
- The gathered data is **processed** and **normalized** to be understood by the SIEM correlation engine. The raw data must be written or read in a format that can be comprehended by the SIEM and converted into a common format from various types of datasets. This process is called **data normalization and data aggregation.**
- Finally, the most crucial part of SIEM, where SOC teams utilize the normalized data collected by the SIEM to create **various detection rules, dashboards, visualizations, alerts, and incidents**. This enables the SOC team to identify potential security risks and respond swiftly to security incidents.

# Introduction to Elastic Stack
The Elastic stack, created by Elastic, is an open-source collection of mainly three applications (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) that work in harmony to offer users comprehensive search and visualization capabilities for real-time analysis and exploration of log file sources.

![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FwH38B5kkop3yRwXNzd7x%2Fuploads%2FKBefwBNNUjtrWoAEpUeS%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=d9162784-7f95-4c6f-a825-a69a035e3942)


The high-level architecture of the Elastic stack can be enhanced in resource-intensive environments with the addition of Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Redis for buffering and resiliency, and nginx for security.

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/211/elastic1.png)


Let's delve into each component of the Elastic stack.

`Elasticsearch` is a distributed and JSON-based search engine, designed with RESTful APIs. As the core component of the Elastic stack, it handles indexing, storing, and querying. Elasticsearch empowers users to conduct sophisticated queries and perform analytics operations on the log file records processed by Logstash.

`Logstash` is responsible for collecting, transforming, and transporting log file records. Its strength lies in its ability to consolidate data from various sources and normalize them. Logstash operates in three main areas:

- `Process input`: Logstash ingests log file records from remote locations, converting them into a format that machines can understand. It can receive records through different [input methods](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/input-plugins.html), such as reading from a flat file, a TCP socket, or directly from syslog messages. After processing the input, Logstash proceeds to the next function.

- `Transform and enrich log records`: Logstash offers numerous ways to [modify a log record](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/filter-plugins.html)'s format and even content. Specifically, filter plugins can perform intermediary processing on an event, often based on a predefined condition. Once a log record is transformed, Logstash processes it further.

- `Send log records to Elasticsearch`: Logstash utilizes [output plugins](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/output-plugins.html) to transmit log records to Elasticsearch.

`Kibana` serves as the visualization tool for Elasticsearch documents. Users can view the data stored in Elasticsearch and execute queries through Kibana. Additionally, Kibana simplifies the comprehension of query results using tables, charts, and custom dashboards.

Note: `Beats` is an additional component of the Elastic stack. These lightweight, single-purpose data shippers are designed to be installed on remote machines to forward logs and metrics to either Logstash or Elasticsearch directly. Beats simplify the process of collecting data from various sources and ensure that the Elastic Stack receives the necessary information for analysis and visualization.

`Unified Data View`: ECS enforces a structured and consistent approach to data, allowing for unified views across multiple data sources. For instance, data originating from Windows logs, network traffic, endpoint events, or cloud-based data sources can all be searched and correlated using the same field names.

`Improved Search Efficiency`: By standardizing the field names across different data types, ECS simplifies the process of writing queries in KQL. This means that analysts can efficiently construct queries without needing to remember specific field names for each data source.

`Enhanced Correlation`: ECS allows for easier correlation of events across different sources, which is pivotal in cybersecurity investigations. For example, you can correlate an IP address involved in a security incident with network traffic logs, firewall logs, and endpoint data to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the incident.

`Better Visualizations`: Consistent field naming conventions improve the efficacy of visualizations in Kibana. As all data sources adhere to the same schema, creating dashboards and visualizations becomes easier and more intuitive. This can help in spotting trends, identifying anomalies, and visualizing security incidents.

`Interoperability with Elastic Solutions`: Using ECS fields ensures full compatibility with advanced Elastic Stack features and solutions, such as Elastic Security, Elastic Observability, and Elastic Machine Learning. This allows for advanced threat hunting, anomaly detection, and performance monitoring.

`Future-proofing`: As ECS is the foundational schema across the Elastic Stack, adopting ECS ensures future compatibility with enhancements and new features that are introduced into the Elastic ecosystem.

**Elastic Common Schema (ECS)** is a shared and extensible vocabulary for events and logs across the Elastic Stack, which ensures consistent field formats across different data sources. When it comes to Kibana Query Language (KQL) searches within the Elastic Stack, using ECS fields presents several key advantages:

## The Elastic Common Schema (ECS)

- [Elastic Common Schema (ECS)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-reference.html)
- [Elastic Common Schema (ECS) event fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-event.html)
- [Winlogbeat fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/current/exported-fields-winlog.html)
- [Winlogbeat ECS fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/current/exported-fields-ecs.html)
- [Winlogbeat security module fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/master/exported-fields-security.html)
- [Filebeat fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/exported-fields.html)
- [Filebeat ECS fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/exported-fields-ecs.html)

It could be a good idea to first familiarize ourselves with Elastic's comprehensive documentation before delving into the "Discover" feature. The documentation provides a wealth of information on the different types of fields we may encounter. Some good resources to start with are:

**Data and field identification approach 2: Leverage Elastic's documentation**

- By using a search engine for the Windows event logs that are associated with failed login attempts, we will come across resources such as [https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=4625](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=4625)
- Using KQL's free text search we can search for `"4625"`. In the returned records we notice `event.code:4625`, `winlog.event_id:4625`, and `@timestamp`
	- `event.code` is related to the [Elastic Common Schema (ECS)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-event.html#field-event-code)
	- `winlog.event_id` is related to [Winlogbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/current/exported-fields-winlog.html)
	- If the organization we work for is using the Elastic stack across all offices and security departments, it is preferred that we use the ECS fields in our queries for reasons that we will cover at the end of this section.
	- `@timestamp` typically contains the time extracted from the original event and it is [different from `event.created`](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/winlogbeat-timestamp-different-with-event-create-time/278160) ![Free Text Search 1](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/211/discover1.png)
- When it comes to disabled accounts, the aforementioned resource informs us that a SubStatus value of 0xC0000072 inside a 4625 Windows event log indicates that the account is currently disabled. Again using KQL's free text search we can search for `"0xC0000072"`. By expanding the returned record we notice `winlog.event_data.SubStatus` that is related to [Winlogbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/current/exported-fields-winlog.html) ![Free Text Search 2](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/211/discover2.png)

Using the [Discover](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/discover.html) feature, we can effortlessly explore and sift through the available data, as well as gain insights into the architecture of the available fields, before we start constructing KQL queries.

**Data and field identification approach 1: Leverage KQL's free text search**

```KQL
event.code:4625 AND winlog.event_data.SubStatus:0xC0000072 AND @timestamp >= "2023-03-03T00:00:00.000Z" AND @timestamp <= "2023-03-06T23:59:59.999Z"
```

Introduction To The Elastic Stack

**Example**: Identify failed login attempts against disabled accounts that took place between March 3rd 2023 and March 6th 2023 KQL:

"How can I identify the available fields and values?", you may ask. Let's see how we could have identified the available fields and values that we used in this section.

### How To Identify The Available Data

This query (if extended) can be useful in identifying potentially malicious login attempts targeted at administrator accounts.

The Kibana KQL query event.code:4625 AND user.name: admin* filters data in Kibana to show events that have the Windows event code 4625 (failed login attempts) and where the username starts with "admin", such as "admin", "administrator", "admin123", etc.

`event.code:4625 AND user.name: admin*`


Wildcards and Regular Expressions: KQL supports wildcards and regular expressions to search for patterns in field values. For example:

By using this query, SOC analysts can identify failed login attempts against disabled accounts that took place between March 3rd 2023 and March 6th 2023

```KQL ln:false title:" Windows Failed Logins with Disabled users"
event.code:4625 AND winlog.event_data.SubStatus:0xC0000072 AND @timestamp >= "2023-03-03T00:00:00.000Z" AND @timestamp <= "2023-03-06T23:59:59.999Z"
```

`Comparison Operators`: KQL supports various comparison operators such as`:`, `:>`, `:>=`, `:<`, `:<=`, and `:!`. These operators enable you to define precise conditions for matching field values. For instance:

By using this query, SOC analysts can identify failed login attempts against disabled accounts. Such a behavior requires further investigation, as the disabled account's credentials may have been identified somehow by an attacker.

In Windows, the SubStatus value indicates the reason for a login failure. A SubStatus value of 0xC0000072 indicates that the account is currently disabled.

The KQL query `event.code:4625 AND winlog.event_data.SubStatus:0xC0000072` filters data in Kibana to show events that have the Windows event code 4625 (failed login attempts) and the SubStatus value of 0xC0000072.

event.code:4625 AND winlog.event_data.SubStatus:0xC0000072

Introduction To The Elastic Stack

`Logical Operators`: KQL supports logical operators AND, OR, and NOT for constructing more complex queries. Parentheses can be used to group expressions and control the order of evaluation. For example:

This query returns records containing the string "svc-sql1" in any indexed field.

```
"svc-sql1"
```


`Free Text Search`: KQL supports free text search, allowing you to search for a specific term across multiple fields without specifying a field name. For instance:

By further refining the query with additional conditions, such as the source IP address, username, or time range, SOC analysts can gain more specific insights and effectively investigate potential security incidents.

By using this query, SOC analysts can identify failed login attempts on Windows machines within the Elasticsearch index, and investigate the source of the attempts and potential security threats. This type of query can help identify brute force attacks, password guessing, and other suspicious activities related to login attempts on Windows systems.

The KQL query event.code:4625 filters data in Kibana to show events that have the [Windows event code 4625](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=4625). This Windows event code is associated with failed login attempts in a Windows operating system.

`event.code:4625`


`Basic Structure`: KQL queries are composed of `field:value` pairs, with the field representing the data's attribute and the value representing the data you're searching for. For example:

Kibana Query Language (KQL) is a powerful and user-friendly query language designed specifically for searching and analyzing data in Kibana. It simplifies the process of extracting insights from your indexed Elasticsearch data, offering a more intuitive approach than Elasticsearch's Query DSL. Let's explore the technical aspects and key components of the KQL language.

Beats -> Elasticsearch

As Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts, we are likely to extensively use Kibana as our primary interface when working with the Elastic stack. Therefore, it is essential to become proficient with its functionalities and features.

To detect security-related incidents, Elasticsearch can be used to perform searches and correlations on the collected security data.

To implement the Elastic stack as a SIEM solution, security-related data from various sources such as firewalls, IDS/IPS, and endpoints should be ingested into the Elastic stack using Logstash. Elasticsearch should be configured to store and index the security data, and Kibana should be used to create custom dashboards and visualizations to provide insights into security-related events.

The Elastic stack can be used as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution to collect, store, analyze, and visualize security-related data from various sources.

# SOC Definition and Fundamentals
## What Is A SOC?

A Security Operations Center (SOC) is an essential facility that houses a team of information security experts responsible for continuously monitoring and evaluating an organization's security status.

Main Objective:

- Identify
- Examine
- Address cybersecurity incidents

The SOC team usually consists of proficient security analysts, engineers, and managers overseeing security operations. They collaborate closely with organizational incident response teams to guarantee security concerns are promptly detected and resolved.

### Technologies used by SOC

- SIEM
- Firewalls
- IDS 
- IPS
- EDR/XDR
- Log Analysis tools (Wireshark)
### How Does A SOC Work?

The primary function of the SOC team is to **manage the ongoing operational aspect of enterprise information security** rather than _concentrating on the development of security strategies, designing security architecture, or implementing protective measures_.

The SOC team mainly consists of security analysts who work collectively to **==detect, assess, respond to, report on, and prevent==** cybersecurity incidents.

Besides the primary responsibilities of a SOC team, some SOCs may possess advanced capabilities like forensic analysis and malware analysis. These abilities enable the SOC team to conduct in-depth investigations of security incidents and examine the root cause of the incident to avert future attacks.

As previously mentioned, the SOC team also collaborates closely with the incident response team to guarantee proper handling of security incidents and the preservation of the organization's security posture.

### Roles Within A SOC
A SOC team consists of diverse roles responsible for handling the continuous, operational aspect of enterprise information security. These roles may encompass:

- `SOC Director`: Responsible for overall management and strategic planning of the SOC, including budgeting, staffing, and alignment with organizational security objectives.
- `SOC Manager`: Oversees day-to-day operations, manages the team, coordinates incident response efforts, and ensures smooth collaboration with other departments.
- `Tier 1 Analyst`: **Monitors** security alerts and events, **triages** potential incidents, and **escalates** them to higher tiers for further investigation.
- `Tier 2 Analyst`: Performs **in-depth analysis** of escalated incidents, identifies patterns and trends, and develops mitigation strategies to address security threats.
- `Tier 3 Analyst`: Provides advanced expertise in handling complex security incidents, **conducts threat hunting** activities, and **collaborates with other teams** to improve the organization's security posture.
- `Detection Engineer`: A Detection Engineer is responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining detection rules and signatures for security monitoring tools, such as SIEM, IDS/IPS, and EDR solutions. They work closely with security analysts to identify gaps in detection coverage and continuously improve the organization's ability to detect and respond to threats.
- `Incident Responder`: Takes charge of active security incidents, carries out in-depth digital forensics and containment and remediation efforts, and collaborates with other teams to restore affected systems and prevent future occurrences.
- `Threat Intelligence Analyst`: Gathers, analyzes, and disseminates threat intelligence data to help SOC team members better understand the threat landscape and proactively defend against emerging risks.
- `Security Engineer`: **Develops, deploys, and maintains security tools, technologies, and infrastructure, and provides technical expertise** to the SOC team.

---
It is important to note that the specific roles and responsibilities within each tier can vary depending on the organization's size, industry, and specific security requirements.

In general, the tiered structure can be described as follows:

- `Tier 1 Analysts`: Also known as "**first responders,**" these analysts monitor security events and alerts, perform initial triage, and escalate potential incidents to higher tiers for further investigation. Their main goal is to quickly identify and prioritize security incidents.
- `Tier 2 Analysts`: These analysts are more experienced and perform deeper analysis of escalated incidents. They identify patterns and trends, develop mitigation strategies, and sometimes assist in incident response efforts. They may also be responsible for tuning security monitoring tools to reduce false positives and improve detection capabilities.
- `Tier 3 Analysts`: Often considered the most experienced and knowledgeable analysts on the team, Tier 3 analysts handle the most complex and high-profile security incidents. They may also engage in proactive threat hunting, develop advanced detection and prevention strategies, and collaborate with other teams to improve the organization's overall security posture.

# MITRE ATT&CK and Security Operations
### What Is MITRE ATT&CK?

The [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) framework serves as an extensive, regularly updated resource outlining the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by cyber threat actors. This structured methodology assists cybersecurity experts in comprehending, identifying, and reacting to threats more proactively and knowledgeably.

The ATT&CK framework comprises matrices tailored to various computing contexts, such as enterprise, mobile, or cloud systems. Each matrix links the tactics (the goals attackers aim to achieve) and techniques (the methods used to accomplish their objectives) to distinct TTPs. This linkage allows security teams to methodically examine and predict attacker activities.

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/211/MITRE.gif)

### What Is Alert Triaging?

`Alert triaging`, performed by a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst, is the **process of evaluating and prioritizing security alerts generated by various monitoring and detection systems to determine their level of threat and potential impact on an organization's systems and data**. It involves systematically reviewing and categorizing alerts to effectively allocate resources and respond to security incidents.

`Escalation` is an important aspect of alert triaging in a SOC environment. The escalation process typically involves notifying supervisors, incident response teams, or designated individuals within the organization who have the authority to make decisions and coordinate the response effort.

The SOC analyst provides detailed information about the alert, including its severity, potential impact, and any relevant findings from the initial investigation. This allows the decision-makers to assess the situation and determine the appropriate course of action, such as involving specialized teams, initiating broader incident response procedures, or engaging external resources if necessary.

Escalation **ensures that critical alerts receive prompt attention and facilitates effective coordination among different stakeholders, enabling a timely and efficient response to potential security incidents.** It helps to leverage the expertise and decision-making capabilities of individuals who are responsible for managing and mitigating higher-level threats or incidents within the organization.

What Is The Ideal Triaging Process?

1. Initial Alert Review:
	- Thoroughly review the initial alert, including metadata, timestamp, source IP, destination IP, affected systems, and triggering rule/signature.
	- Analyze associated logs (network traffic, system, application) to understand the alert's context.

2. `Alert Classification`:
	- Classify the alert based on severity, impact, and urgency using the organization's predefined classification system.

3. `Alert Correlation`:
	- Cross-reference the alert with related alerts, events, or incidents to identify patterns, similarities, or potential indicators of compromise (IOCs).
	- Query the SIEM or log management system to gather relevant log data.
	- Leverage threat intelligence feeds to check for known attack patterns or malware signatures.

4.  `Enrichment of Alert Data`:
	- Gather additional information to enrich the alert data and gain context:
    - Collect network packet captures, memory dumps, or file samples associated with the alert.   
    - Utilize external threat intelligence sources, open-source tools, or sandboxes to analyze suspicious files, URLs, or IP addresses.       
    - Conduct reconnaissance of affected systems for anomalies (network connections, processes, file modifications).       

5. `Risk Assessment`:    
	- Evaluate the potential risk and impact to critical assets, data, or infrastructure:
    - Consider the value of affected systems, sensitivity of data, compliance requirements, and regulatory implications.    
    - Determine likelihood of a successful attack or potential lateral movement.    

6.  `Contextual Analysis`:
    - The analyst considers the context surrounding the alert, including the affected assets, their criticality, and the sensitivity of the data they handle.
    - They evaluate the security controls in place, such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and endpoint protection solutions, to determine if the alert indicates a potential control failure or evasion technique.
    - The analyst assesses the relevant compliance requirements, industry regulations, and contractual obligations to understand the implications of the alert on the organization's legal and regulatory compliance posture.
7.  `Incident Response Planning`:
	- Initiate an incident response plan if the alert is significant:
    - Document alert details, affected systems, observed behaviors, potential IOCs, and enrichment data.     
    - Assign incident response team members with defined roles and responsibilities.
    - Coordinate with other teams (network operations, system administrators, vendors) as necessary.

8.  `Consultation with IT Operations`:
	- Assess the need for additional context or missing information by consulting with IT operations or relevant departments:    
		- Engage in discussions or meetings to gather insights on the affected systems, recent changes, or ongoing maintenance activities.      
		- Collaborate to understand any known issues, misconfigurations, or network changes that could potentially generate false-positive alerts.        
        - Gain a holistic understanding of the environment and any non-malicious activities that might have triggered the alert.     
	    - Document the insights and information obtained during the consultation.    

9. `Response Execution`:
	- Based on the alert review, risk assessment, and consultation, determine the appropriate response actions.
	- If the additional context resolves the alert or identifies it as a non-malicious event, take necessary actions without escalation.	
	- If the alert still indicates potential security concerns or requires further investigation, proceed with the incident response actions.
    
10. `Escalation`:
	- Identify triggers for escalation based on organization's policies and alert severity:
	    - Triggers may include compromise of critical systems/assets, ongoing attacks, unfamiliar/sophisticated techniques, widespread impact, or insider threats.  
	- Assess the alert against escalation triggers, considering potential consequences if not escalated. 
	- Follow internal escalation process, notifying higher-level teams/management responsible for incident response.
	- Provide comprehensive alert summary, severity, potential impact, enrichment data, and risk assessment.
    - Document all communication related to escalation.
    - In some cases, escalate to external entities (law enforcement, incident response providers, CERTs) based on legal/regulatory requirements.
11. `Continuous Monitoring`:
    - Continuously monitor the situation and incident response progress.
    - Maintain open communication with escalated teams, providing updates on developments, findings, or changes in severity/impact.
    - Collaborate closely with escalated teams for a coordinated response.
    
12.  `De-escalation`:
    - Evaluate the need for de-escalation as the incident response progresses and the situation is under control.
    - De-escalate when the risk is mitigated, incident is contained, and further escalation is unnecessary.
    - Notify relevant parties, providing a summary of actions taken, outcomes, and lessons learned.
