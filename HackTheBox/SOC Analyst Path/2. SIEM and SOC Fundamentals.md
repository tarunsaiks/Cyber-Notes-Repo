# What is SIEM?
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- merge the management of security data with the supervision of security events.
- theseÂ facilitate real-time evaluations of alerts related to security, which are produced by network hardware and applications.
- SIEM tools possess an extensive range of core functionalities, such as the collection and administration of log events, the capacity to examine log events and supplementary data from various sources, as well as operational features like incident handling, visual summaries, and documentation.
- SIEM systems function by gathering data from a variety of sources, including PCs, network devices, servers, and more. This data is then standardized and consolidated to facilitate ease of analysis.
- SIEM systems generate a vast number of alerts owing to the substantial volume of events produced for each monitored platform.
- Alerts notify Security teams that they must look into a (possible) security event or incident.

# SIEM Business Requirements & Use Cases

### Log Aggregation & Normalization
Log consolidation entails gathering terabytes of security information from vital firewalls, confidential databases, and essential applications.

Utilizing SIEM log consolidation, the SOC team can identify and scrutinize security incidents and events throughout the organization's IT infrastructure. \

By centralizing and correlating information from various sources, SIEM delivers a holistic strategy for threat detection and handling.

This approach allows organizations to recognize patterns, tendencies, and irregularities that could suggest potential security hazards.
