# Windows Event Logging Basics

Windows Event Logs are intrinsic part of Windows OS, stores different components of the system including the system itself, applications running on it, ETW providers, services and others.

Windows event logging offers comprehensive logging capabilities for application errors, security events and diagnostic events. The default Windows event logs consist of `Application`, `Security`, `Setup`, `System`, and `Forwarded Events`.

It should be noted, that the Windows Event Viewer has the ability to open and display previously saved `.evtx` files, which can be then found in the "Saved Logs" section.

### The Anatomy of an Event Log

Application Logs - two levels of events -` Information` or `Error`

**Information** events provide general usage details about the application, such as its start or stop events. 
**Error** events highlight specific errors and often offer detailed insights into the encountered issues.

Each entry in the Windows Event Log is an "Event" and contains the following primary components:

- `Log Name`: The name of the event log (e.g., Application, System, Security, etc.).

- `Source`: The software that logged the event.

- `Event ID`: A unique identifier for the event.

- `Task Category`: This often contains a value or name that can help us understand the purpose or use of the event.

- `Level`: The severity of the event (Information, Warning, Error, Critical, and Verbose).

- `Keywords`: Keywords are flags that allow us to categorize events in ways beyond the other classification options. These are generally broad categories, such as "Audit Success" or "Audit Failure" in the Security log. This field is very useful when filtering event logs for specific types of events.

- `User`: The user account that was logged on when the event occurred.

- `OpCode`: This field can identify the specific operation that the event reports.

- `Logged`: The date and time when the event was logged.

- `Computer`: The name of the computer where the event occurred.

- `XML Data`: All the above information is also included in an XML format along with additional event data.

The `Event ID` in the top left corner serves as a unique identifier, which can be further researched on Microsoft's website to gather additional information. The "**SideBySide**" label next to the event ID represents the event source. Below, we find the general error description, often containing rich details. By clicking on the details, we can further analyze the event's impact using XML or a well-formatted view.
