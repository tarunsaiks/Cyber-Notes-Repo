# Windows Event Logging Basics
#windows #event-viewer #event-logging

Windows Event Logs are intrinsic part of Windows OS, stores different components of the system including the system itself, applications running on it, ETW providers, services and others.

Windows event logging offers comprehensive logging capabilities for application errors, security events and diagnostic events. The default Windows event logs consist of `Application`, `Security`, `Setup`, `System`, and `Forwarded Events`.

![](../../Pasted%20image%2020250415200108.png)

It should be noted, that the Windows Event Viewer has the ability to open and display previously saved `.evtx` files, which can be then found in the "Saved Logs" section.

## The Anatomy of an Event Log
#event-logging

Application Logs - two levels of events -` Information` or `Error`

**Information** events provide general usage details about the application, such as its start or stop events. 
**Error** events highlight specific errors and often offer detailed insights into the encountered issues.
![](../../Pasted%20image%2020250415200321.png)

Each entry in the Windows Event Log is an "Event" and contains the following primary components:

- `Log Name`: The name of the event log (e.g., Application, System, Security, etc.).

- `Source`: The software that logged the event.

- `Event ID`: A unique identifier for the event. #event-id

- `Task Category`: This often contains a value or name that can help us understand the purpose or use of the event.

- `Level`: The severity of the event (Information, Warning, Error, Critical, and Verbose).

- `Keywords`: Keywords are flags that allow us to categorize events in ways beyond the other classification options. These are generally broad categories, such as "Audit Success" or "Audit Failure" in the Security log. This field is very useful when filtering event logs for specific types of events.

- `User`: The user account that was logged on when the event occurred.

- `OpCode`: This field can identify the specific operation that the event reports.

- `Logged`: The date and time when the event was logged.

- `Computer`: The name of the computer where the event occurred.

- `XML Data`: All the above information is also included in an XML format along with additional event data.

The `Event ID` in the top left corner serves as a unique identifier, which can be further researched on Microsoft's website to gather additional information. The "**SideBySide**" label next to the event ID represents the event source. Below, we find the general error description, often containing rich details. By clicking on the details, we can further analyze the event's impact using XML or a well-formatted view.

![](../../Pasted%20image%2020250415200244.png)

Additionally, we can extract supplementary information from the event log, such as the process ID where the error occurred, enabling more precise analysis.

![](../../Pasted%20image%2020250415200524.png)
Few of the crucial details we can find on this event viewer are:
- This event 4625 - signifies a creation of logon session on the destination machine, originating from the accessed computer where the session was established.
- We also find **Logon ID** which allows us to correlate this logon with any other events with same ID.
- **Logon Type** is indicating 5, which according to [Microsoft Documentation]([Administrative tools and logon types reference - Windows Server | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/securing-privileged-access/reference-tools-logon-types)), refers to `Service Logon` --> `SYSTEM` initiated the service.
- ![Windows Logon Type 5 - Service Logon](../../Pasted%20image%2020250415200939.png)

## Leveraging Custom XML Queries
#custom_xml_queries #event-viewer  #windows
We can also create custom XML Queries to identify related events like say using Logon ID. 

Filter Current Log -> XML -> Edit Query Manually

![](../../Pasted%20image%2020250415201631.png)SubjectLogonId --> Logon ID

```XML
<QueryList>
	 <Query Id="0" Path="Security">
		<Select Path="Security"> *[EventData[Data[@Name='SubjectLogonId']='0x3E7']]
		</Select>
	</Query>
</QueryList>
```

For further guidance, Microsoft offers informative articles on [advanced XML filtering in the Windows Event Viewer](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-directory-services-team/advanced-xml-filtering-in-the-windows-event-viewer/ba-p/399761). By constructing such customized XML Queries, we can narrow down our focus to responsible logs and accounts.


> [!Important]SYSTEM account a.k.a SubjectLogonId=0x3E7
> `SubjectLogonId = 0x3E7` in decimal is 999 --> This refers to `SYSTEM` account, which is highest-privileged account used by Windows OS to perform system-level tasks.


Delving into the log details progressively reveals a narrative. For instance, the analysis begins with [**Event ID 4907**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4907), which signifies an **audit policy change**. Within the [event description](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4907), we find valuable insights, such as "This event generates when the SACL of an object (for example, a registry key or file) was changed."

If you’re not familiar with what a **SACL** is, you can learn more by visiting this [link about Access Control Lists (ACLs)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists).

The **"S" in SACL stands for System Access Control List**. It's used by system administrators to **track and log who tries to access protected files or resources** on a system.

Each entry in a SACL (called an **Access Control Entry** or **ACE**) tells the system **what kind of access attempts (like read, write, delete)** should be logged, and **who those rules apply to**.

SACLs can be set to create logs for:

- **Failed access attempts**
- **Successful access attempts**
- **Or both**

These logs are saved in the **security event log**, so administrators can review them later. So basically, a SACL is like a **security camera for your files**—it doesn’t stop people from getting in, but it **records the attempts** based on rules set by the admin, and logs them in the **security event log** for review.

To learn more, check out the section on  [Audit Generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/audit-generation) and [SACL Access Right](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/sacl-access-right) in the documentation.

While I was struggling to understand what the above two screenshots signify and investigate, my good old friend ChatGPT, just helped me understand it even better.

#### ChatGPT version of Investigation
You're looking at **Event ID 4907**, which means **“Auditing settings on object were changed.”** This is part of Windows Security Auditing and specifically relates to **changes in SACL (System Access Control List)**.

Let's break this down:

---

### 📌 **Event Summary**

- **Event ID:** 4907
- **Event Type:** Success Audit
- **Category:** Audit Policy Change
- **Description:** Some process changed the **auditing rules** (SACL) on a file.

---

### 🔐 **What Happened?**

Windows detected that **auditing settings (SACL)** were changed on a file.

- **ObjectName:**  
    `C:\$WINDOWS.~BT\NewOS\Windows\System32\Recovery\...bootmgfw.efi`  
    This is a **UEFI boot manager file**, typically accessed during Windows upgrades or system recovery.
    

---

### 🧾 **Key Fields Explained**

|Field|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Security ID:** SYSTEM|Indicates the SYSTEM account made the change (most privileged local account).|
|**Logon ID:** `0x3E7`|Confirms the action was taken by the SYSTEM account (as discussed before).|
|**Process Name:** `C:\$WINDOWS.~BT\Sources\SetupHost.exe`|This is a Windows Setup process, likely part of a Windows update or installation.|
|**SubjectUserName:** ARASHPARSA2BB9$|The machine account name — not a user. The `$` at the end confirms it's a computer account.|


### 🧠 In Simple Terms

Windows setup (SetupHost.exe) — running as SYSTEM — **changed the auditing settings** on a critical system boot file during a Windows update or recovery setup. The event was logged because changes to what is being audited (e.g., read/write access to that file) can be important from a **forensics or security** perspective.

This is a **normal event during system upgrades or Windows installation**, especially when `SetupHost.exe` is involved.

#### Decoding OldSd and NewSd
Let's dive into decoding the `OldSd` and `NewSd` fields from the event to better understand **what exactly changed in the auditing rules (SACL)**.

---

### 📜 **What Are `OldSd` and `NewSd`?**

- These are **Security Descriptors** in **Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL)** format.
- They define permissions, auditing rules, and ownership for an object (like a file).
- You're mostly interested in the **`S:` section**, which controls **auditing (SACL)**.

---

### 📌 Your `NewSd` field:

`S:ARAI(AU;SAFA;DCLCRPCRSDWDWO;;;WD)`

This breaks down into an **SACL** entry. Here's how to understand it:

#### 🔍 Let's decode:

- **S:** Start of the SACL (System Access Control List).
    
- **ARAI:** These are **SACL control flags**:
    
    - **AR** – Audit success
        
    - **AI** – Audit failure  
        Together, it means: audit both successful **and** failed attempts.
        

#### Inside the parentheses:

`(AU;SAFA;DCLCRPCRSDWDWO;;;WD)`

|Part|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**AU**|Applies to authenticated users|
|**SAFA**|Success and Failure audit|
|**DCLCRPCRSDWDWO**|These are **access rights being audited** (explained below)|
|**;;;WD**|Trustee (the account being audited) — in this case, **WD** = **Everyone (World)**|

#### 📘 Access Rights (`DCLCRPCRSDWDWO`)

This is a combo of individual file access rights:

- **DC** – Delete Child
    
- **LC** – List Children (read folder)
    
- **RP** – Read Permissions
    
- **CR** – Create File (write data)
    
- **SD** – Delete
    
- **WD** – Write DAC (change permissions)
    
- **WO** – Write Owner (take ownership)
    

Together, this means: audit if **anyone** (WD) tries to do **anything meaningful** with this file — read, write, delete, take ownership, etc.

---

### ⚠️ `OldSd` is blank

This means **there were no previous auditing rules set** on this object. The new rule (`NewSd`) was just added.

---

### ✅ Summary

A Windows Setup process (`SetupHost.exe`) **added an auditing rule** to monitor **all types of access (success and failure)** to a critical boot file by **anyone** (Everyone group). This is likely a **normal part of a Windows Update** or setup process to ensure tracking of access to sensitive files.

Remember, one of the key aspects of threat detection is having a good understanding of what is "normal" in our environment. Anomalies that might indicate a threat in one environment could be normal behavior in another. It's crucial to tune our monitoring and alerting systems to our environment to minimize false positives and make real threats easier to spot. In addition, it's essential to have a centralized log management solution in place that can collect, parse, and alert on these events in real-time. Regularly monitoring and reviewing these logs can help in early detection and mitigation of threats. Lastly, we need to make sure to correlate these logs with other system and security logs to get a more holistic view of the security events in our environment.

# Analyzing Evil with Sysmon and Event Logs

## Sysmon Basics
#sysmon
`System Monitor (Sysmon)` is a Windows system service and device driver that remains resident across system reboots to monitor and log system activity to the Windows event log. Sysmon provides detailed information about process creation, network connections, changes to file creation time, and more.


> [!resource] Sysmon - Documentation
> Refer this documentation - [Sysmon - Sysinternals | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)


Sysmon's primary components include:

- A Windows service for monitoring system activity.
- A device driver that assists in capturing the system activity data.
- An event log to display captured activity data.

It gives ability to log information that we can not typically see in Security Event Logs and this is useful for incident response and forensic investigations. 

Sysmon also categorizes different types of system activities using event ID's, where each event ID corresponds to specific type of event. For example:
- Event ID `1` - `Process Creation`
- Event ID `2` - `A proccess changed a file creation time` - **pretty useful, innit??**
- Event ID `3` - `Network Connection`
- Event ID `4` - `Sysmon service state changed`

Detailed table below:

| Event ID | Tag                    | Event                                            |

| **29**   | FileExecutableDetected | File Executable Detected                         |

**Sysmon** uses an XML-based configuration file. The configuration file allows you to include or exclude certain types of events based on different attributes like process names, IP addresses, etc.

## Detection Example 1: Detecting DLL Hijacking

To detect a DLL hijack, we need to focus on `Event Type 7`, which corresponds to module load events. To achieve this, we need to modify the `sysmonconfig-export.xml` 


> [!resource] Sysmon Config File
> Sysmon configuration file downloaded from [https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config).


![](../../Pasted%20image%2020250416194426.png)

In the case of detecting DLL hijacks, we change the "include" to "exclude" to ensure that nothing is excluded, allowing us to capture the necessary data.

![XML snippet with RuleGroup, ImageLoad set to 'exclude', and a note about using 'include' with no rules.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/216/image15.png)

Update installation using the following command:
```cmd
C:\Tools\Sysmon> sysmon.exe -c sysmonconfig-export.xml
```

After modifying the Sysmon configuration file, we can start observing few image load events with Event ID 7.  To view these events, navigate to the Event Viewer and access "Applications and Services" -> "Microsoft" -> "Windows" -> "Sysmon." A quick check will reveal the presence of the targeted event ID.

## Detection Example 2: Detecting Unmanaged PowerShell/C-Sharp Injection

Before delving into detection techniques, let's gain a brief understanding of C# and its runtime environment. C# is considered a "managed" language, meaning it requires a backend runtime to execute its code. The [Common Language Runtime (CLR)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/clr) serves as this runtime environment. [Managed code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/managed-code) does not directly run as assembly; instead, it is compiled into a bytecode format that the runtime processes and executes. Consequently, a managed process relies on the CLR to execute C# code.

A **managed process** runs code that is executed by the .NET runtime (CLR), like C# applications, while an **unmanaged process** runs code directly through the operating system without needing the CLR, like native Windows system processes or C/C++ programs.

As defenders, we can leverage this knowledge to detect unusual C# injections or executions within our environment. To accomplish this, we can utilize a useful utility called [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/).

![Task Manager showing processes like Microsoft.Photos.exe, msedge.exe, powershell.exe, ProcessHacker.exe, with CPU and memory usage details.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/216/image24.png)

By using Process Hacker, we can observe a range of processes within our environment. Sorting the processes by name, we can identify interesting color-coded distinctions. Notably, "powershell.exe", a managed process, is highlighted in green compared to other processes. Hovering over powershell.exe reveals the label "Process is managed (.NET)," confirming its managed status.

Examining the module loads for `powershell.exe`, by right-clicking on `powershell.exe`, clicking "Properties", and navigating to "Modules", we can find relevant information.

### 🧠 **Quick C# and CLR Primer**

- **C# is a managed language**, meaning it **doesn’t run directly as machine code**.
- Instead, it’s **compiled into intermediate code (bytecode)** and executed by the **.NET runtime**.
- The **Common Language Runtime (CLR)** is the engine that runs this managed code.
- So, **if a process is running C# code, it needs the CLR (like `clr.dll`) loaded** into memory. It suggests a potential [execute-assembly](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/blog/cobalt-strike-3-11-the-snake-that-eats-its-tail/) or [unmanaged PowerShell injection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tvfb9poTKg&ab_channel=RaphaelMudge) attack.
### 🛠️ **How Can We Use This to Detect Suspicious Behavior?**

Normally, only certain programs (like `powershell.exe`) should load CLR-related DLLs like `clr.dll` or `clrjit.dll`.


> [!keyword] clr.dll and clrjit.dll - if any other process than powershell.exe
>  if you see random system processes like **spoolsv.exe (the print spooler)** loading those DLLs, that’s a **red flag** — it means someone might be injecting C# code into it!


To showcase unmanaged PowerShell injection, we can inject an [unmanaged PowerShell-like DLL](https://github.com/leechristensen/UnmanagedPowerShell) into a random process, such as `spoolsv.exe`. We can do that by utilizing the [PSInject project](https://github.com/EmpireProject/PSInject) in the following manner.


> [!keyword] Unmanaged PowerShell Injection
> Unmanaged PowerShell Injection is a technique where **PowerShell code is executed inside another process** ==without using the traditional== `powershell.exe` binary.


  Analyzing Evil With Sysmon & Event Logs

```powershell
 powershell -ep bypass
 Import-Module .\Invoke-PSInject.ps1
 Invoke-PSInject -ProcId [Process ID of spoolsv.exe] -PoshCode "V3JpdGUtSG9zdCAiSGVsbG8sIEd1cnU5OSEi"
```

After the injection, we observe that `spoolsv.exe` transitions from an unmanaged to a managed state.

Additionally, by referring to both the related "Modules" tab of Process Hacker and Sysmon `Event ID 7`, we can examine the DLL load information to validate the presence of the aforementioned DLLs.

**Process Hacker** is a great utility to inspect running processes:

- It shows which processes are **managed (running .NET code)** — these show up **green**.
- You can check what **DLLs** are loaded in a process by:
    - Right-clicking the process → **Properties** → **Modules** tab.
    - Look for `clr.dll`, `clrjit.dll`, etc.

Also, **Sysmon** (with Event ID 7) helps log **DLL load events**, giving us even more visibility.

## Detection Example 3: Detecting Credential Dumping
### 🧠 **What is Credential Dumping?**

**Credential dumping** is when an attacker tries to extract usernames, passwords, and hashes from a compromised system — usually by targeting **LSASS.exe**, the Windows process responsible for managing user logins and credentials.

### 🛠️ **What Does Mimikatz Do?**

[Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) is a powerful post-exploitation tool used by attackers and red teamers. One of its key commands is:

`sekurlsa::logonpasswords`

This command pulls **password hashes** or even **plaintext credentials** from [Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Security_Authority_Subsystem_Service) memory. 

**lsass.exe** is responsible for managing user credentials and is a primary target for credential-dumping tools like Mimikatz. 

### 🧪 **How the Attack Happens (Step-by-step)**

1. **Attacker runs Mimikatz** on a machine.
2. Grants itself the `SeDebugPrivilege` (needed to access sensitive processes like LSASS).
3. Executes `sekurlsa::logonpasswords` to **dump credentials**.

🔓 The attacker now has usernames, NTLM hashes, and maybe even plaintext passwords.

### 🔍 **How to Detect It (With Sysmon)**

We use **Sysmon Event ID 10: ProcessAccess**  
This event logs **when one process tries to access another**, which is key here.

> [!ioc] Credential Dumping
> - A **non-standard process** (e.g., `AgentEXE.exe` from Downloads folder)
> - Trying to access **lsass.exe** 
> - The accessing user (e.g., `waldo`) being different from the target user (`SYSTEM`)
> - `SeDebugPrivileges` requested, used primarily for debugging

✅ These are **red flags** of credential dumping.

# Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)

TLDR - `Event Tracing For Windows (ETW)` is a general-purpose, high-speed tracing facility provided by the operating system.

Using a buffering and logging mechanism implemented in the kernel, ETW provides a tracing mechanism for events raised by both user-mode applications and kernel-mode device drivers. It's architecture facilitates dynamic generation, collection and analysis of various events in the system.

ETW captures a diverse set of events, spanning system calls, process creation and termination, network activity, file and registry modifications, and numerous other dimensions.
