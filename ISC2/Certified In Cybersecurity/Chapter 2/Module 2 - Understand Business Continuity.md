The intent of a business continuity plan is to sustain business operations while recovering from a significant disruption. An event has created a disturbance in the environment, and now you need to know how to maintain the business. 

A key part of the plan is communication, including multiple contact methodologies and backup numbers in case of a disruption of power or communications. Many organizations will establish a phone tree, so that if one person is not available, they know who else to call. Organizations will go through their procedures and checklists to make sure they know exactly who is responsible for which action. No matter how many times they have flown, without fail, pilots go through a checklist before take-off. Similarly, there must be established procedures and a thorough checklist, so that no vital element of business continuity will be missed. 

We call the appropriate individuals and start to activate the business continuity plan. Management must be included, because sometimes priorities may change depending on the situation. Individuals with proper authority must be there to execute operations, for instance, if there are critical areas that need to be shut down. 

We need to have at hand the critical contact numbers for the supply chain, as well as law enforcement and other sites outside of the facility. For example, a hospital may suffer a severe cyberattack that affects communications from the pharmacy, the internet or phone lines. In the United States, in case of this type of cyberattack that knocks out communications, specific numbers in specific networks can bypass the normal cell phone services and use military-grade networks. Those will be assigned to authorized individuals for hospitals or other critical infrastructures in case of a major disruption or cyberattack, so they can still maintain essential activity.


# Components of a Business Continuity Plan

Business continuity planning (BCP) is the proactive development of procedures to restore business operations after a disaster or other significant disruption to the organization. Members from across the organization should participate in creating the BCP to ensure all systems, processes and operations are accounted for in the plan.

The term business is used often, as this is mostly a business function as opposed to a technical one. However, in order to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information, the technology must align with the business needs.

Here are some common components of a comprehensive business continuity plan:

-   List of the BCP team members, including multiple contact methods and backup members
-   Immediate response procedures and checklists (security and safety procedures, fire suppression procedures, notification of appropriate emergency-response agencies, etc.)
-   Notification systems and call trees for alerting personnel that the BCP is being enacted
-   Guidance for management, including designation of authority for specific managers
-   How/when to enact the plan
-   Contact numbers for critical members of the supply chain (vendors, customers, possible external emergency providers, third-party partners)
