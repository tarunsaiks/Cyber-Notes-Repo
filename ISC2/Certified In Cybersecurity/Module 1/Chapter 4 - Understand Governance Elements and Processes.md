# Governance Elements

Any business or organization exists to fulfill a purpose, whether it is to provide raw materials to an industry, manufacture equipment to build computer hardware, develop software applications, construct buildings or provide goods and services. To complete the objective requires that decisions are made, rules and practices are defined, and policies and procedures are in place to guide the organization in its pursuit of achieving its goals and mission.

When leaders and management implement the systems and structures that the organization will use to achieve its goals, they are guided by laws and regulations created by governments to enact public policy. Laws and regulations guide the development of standards, which cultivate policies, which result in procedures.

How are regulations, standards, policies and procedures related?  It might help to look at the list in reverse.   

-   Procedures are the detailed steps to complete a task that support departmental or organizational policies.
-   Policies are put in place by organizational governance, such as executive management, to provide guidance in all activities to ensure that the organization supports industry standards and regulations.
-   Standards are often used by governance teams to provide a framework to introduce policies and procedures in support of regulations.
-   Regulations are commonly issued in the form of laws, usually from government (not to be confused with governance) and typically carry financial penalties for noncompliance.
