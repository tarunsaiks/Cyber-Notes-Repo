Edge locations are used for content delivery and other AWS services, such as AWS Lambda and Amazon Route 53. They act as a cache and optimization layer between the user and the AWS services, reducing latency and increasing performance for end users. There are over 400 edge locations and 10 regional caches in 90+ cities around the world.
