# IAM

## IAM User and Groups

- IAM - Identity Access Management, Global Service
- Root account created by default, shouldnâ€™t be used or shared. Create users and use that account.
- Create users for people in organization and can be grouped together to form a Group
- Ex : Developers Groups, Group for Business Owner. Groups contain only users.
- A user can belong to multiple groups.
- User and Groups can be assigned JSON documents called **Policies.**

> Tags are key-value pairs you can add to AWS resources to help identify, organize, or search for resources. Choose any tags you want to associate with this user.

## IAM Policies

- A group - **Developers** are assigned a policy, then that policy will be applied to every user that is part of the group **Developers.**
- If a user belongs to two or more groups, then he will inherit policies of all the groups he is part of.
