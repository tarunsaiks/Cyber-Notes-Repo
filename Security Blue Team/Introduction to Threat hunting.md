### Importance of Threat hunting

Organizations across the world face threats every day! Instead of peacefully sitting in the security operations centers (SOC) for alerts to funnel through a ticketing system, professionals need to actively detect and isolate these advanced attacks before grave damages can occur. This is called **Threat Hunting**.

>Threat hunting is an aggressive approach that is built to unhide threats that are hidden in a network or system, evading more standard security tools.

Standard tools like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and SIEMS all rely on alerts to stimulate actions. Alerts are not perfect and they can lead analysts into embarking on a **time-consuming** and **resource-draining chase**. These false positives can make any SOC analyst susceptible to alert fatigue—which can lead to stress and burnout.

By contrast, threat hunters utilize an approach that is less reliant on detection technology (SIEM & Firewalls). They focus more on the attacker’s technique rather than the volatile indicators. This aggressive approach pushes away from the traditional dependence on rules or signatures to trigger alerts. Threat hunters also experience far less mental fatigue than SOC analysts.


## What's the Hype?

The rapid surge in cyber-attacks across the world justifies the need for threat hunters every day. As mentioned, in the previous topic, threat hunting provides organizations an upper hand in the cyber warfare currently taking place. Having a threat hunter in your organization will improve the quality of cybersecurity teams in each organization.

SANS, a private U.S. for-profit company founded in 1989 that specializes in information security, cybersecurity training, and selling certificates, created a poster showcasing the “[Top 20 Coolest Careers in Cybersecurity!](https://www.sans.org/cybersecurity-careers/20-coolest-cyber-security-careers/)” Guess which one is the most popular by looking at the chart linked above. That's right, it's Threat Hunting!

According to Lacework, a cloud security platform that collects & analyzes more data than its competitors, “**nearly 90% of organizations agree that threat hunting should be a top security.**” This makes sense given the current state of cybersecurity. Until all—and I mean all—threats are accurately flagged and eliminated by technology, we need humans with the right tools and expertise to eliminate these potential threats.
