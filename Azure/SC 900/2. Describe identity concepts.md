Learn about the key concepts of authentication and authorization and why identity is important in securing corporate resources. You'll also learn about some identity-related services.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Understand the difference between authentication and authorization.
- Describe the concept of identity as a security perimeter.
- Describe identity-related services.

# Introduction

Every user, device has an identity that can be used to access resources. Identity is the way in which people and things are identified in corporate network and in cloud. 

So, we have to be absolutely certain of who or what is accessing our data and other resources, coz that's basic security. We wouldn't allow some random stranger to our house at 2AM, do we?

# Authentication and Authorization
## Authentication

- the process of proving that a person is who they say they are.
- Asking Username and Password - if correct, you are authenticated, i.e. you are claiming you are an **AUTHENTIC** user by providing something that only you should know (Password).
## Authorization

- Once, you authenticate a user, we need to know if they can access whatever resource they are requesting or looking for, we don't want our intern accessing Intellectual Property, now, do we?
- That's where authorization comes in. **Authorization** determines the level of access or the permissions an authenticated person has to your data and resources. Authorization is sometimes shortened to AuthZ.

# Identity as the primary security perimeter

## **Digital Collaboration and Security Challenges**  
- Employees and partners now collaborate and access resources from anywhere, on any device.  
- The rise of remote work has accelerated this trend.  
- Security is no longer limited to an on-premises network; it now extends to:  
  - **SaaS applications** hosting critical workloads outside the corporate network.  
  - **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)** allowing employees to access resources from personal devices.  
  - **Unmanaged devices** used by partners/customers interacting with corporate data.  
  - **IoT devices** deployed across corporate networks and customer locations.  

## **Identity as the New Security Perimeter**  
- The traditional perimeter-based security model is insufficient.  
- Identity is now the foundation of security in a modern enterprise.  
- **Definition of Identity:** A set of characteristics that define or authenticate a user, device, or application.  
- Identity components:  
  - **Users** (employees, partners, customers)  
  - **Applications** (services, workloads)  
  - **Devices** (corporate or personal endpoints)

## **Four Pillars of an Identity Infrastructure**  
To ensure a secure identity framework, organizations should focus on four key pillars (4A's):  

### **1. Administration**  
- Manages the lifecycle of user, device, and service identities.  
- Controls creation, updates, and deletion of identities.  

### **2. Authentication**  
- Verifies identity by requiring proof (e.g., username, password, MFA).  
- Ensures only legitimate users/services gain access.  

### **3. Authorization**  
- Defines what authenticated identities can access.  
- Determines permissions within applications and services.  

### **4. Auditing**  
- Tracks identity-related actions (who, what, when, where, how).  
- Provides reporting, alerts, and governance for security monitoring.  

## **Key Takeaways**  
- Identity is the core of modern security strategies.  
- A strong identity infrastructure must cover administration, authentication, authorization, and auditing.  
- Implementing robust identity and access controls enhances security and compliance.  

# Role of Identity Provider

Modern authentication is umbrella term for both authentication and authorization methods between client (phone, laptop) and server (website or application). At the center, role of modern authentication is **Identity Provider**.

All services like authentication services are supplied by central identity provider. Information that is used to authenticate is  stored and managed centrally by the identity provider. 

This helps organizations to establish authentication and authorization policies, monitor user behavior, identity suspicious activities and reduce malicious attack attempts.

C - Client
S - Server
IdP - Identity Provider
(n,p) - Name and password
t - Token - cryptographically signed by the IdP
K - Knowledge of signed key, that is provided to check if the token is legit.

### Single sign-on

Another fundamental capability of an identity provider and “modern authentication” is the support for single sign-on (SSO). 

With SSO, the user logs in once and that credential is used to access multiple applications or resources. 

>[!tip] FEDERATION
>When you set up SSO between multiple identity providers, it's called **federation**.


# Directory Services and Active Directory

In Networks, directory is hierarchical structure that stores information about objects on network. (Euughh, almost reminded me of my C++ professor during bachelors)
