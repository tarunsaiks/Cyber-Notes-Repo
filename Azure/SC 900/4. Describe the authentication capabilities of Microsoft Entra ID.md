Learn about the authentication capabilities of Microsoft Entra ID, including multifactor authentication, and how they improve security. You'll also learn about self-service password reset (SSPR) and the password protection and management capabilities.

# Introduction

Authentication is the process of verifying an identity to be legitimate. Passwords are commonly used to authenticate users, but there are better and more secure ways to authenticate.

In this module, you'll learn about the authentication capabilities of Microsoft Entra ID, multifactor authentication, and how it improves security. You'll also find out about the password protection and management capabilities of Microsoft Entra ID.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe the authentication methods of Microsoft Entra ID.
- Describe multifactor authentication in Microsoft Entra ID
- Describe the password protection and management capabilities of Microsoft Entra ID.

# Authentication Methods

One of the main features of an identity platform is to verify, or authenticate, credentials when a user signs in to a device, application, or service. Microsoft Entra ID offers different methods of authentication. 

1. Passwords
2. Phone
3. OATH
4. Passwordless Authentication
5. Windows Hello for Business
6. FIDO2
7. Microsoft Authentication
8. Certificate-based Authentication
9. Primary and secondary authentication

## Passwords

Common authentication form, with many problems, if used with single-factor auth. 
If easy to remember -> easy for hackers to compromise the account.

The use of passwords should be supplemented or replaced with more secure authentication methods available in Microsoft Entra ID.

## Phone

Microsoft Entra ID supports two options for mobile-based authentication.
- SMS-based authentication
- Voice Call verification

### SMS based authentication
Short message service (SMS) used in mobile device text messaging can be used as a primary form of authentication. With SMS-based sign-in, users don't need to know a username and password to access applications and services. The user instead enters their registered mobile phone number, receives a text message with a verification code, and enters that in the sign-in interface.

Users can also choose to verify their identity through SMS text messaging on a mobile phone, as a secondary form of authentication during self-service password reset (SSPR) or Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication. For example, users can supplement their password by using SMS text messaging. An SMS is sent to the mobile phone number containing a verification code. To complete the sign-in process, the verification code provided is entered into the sign-in interface.

### Voice call verification
Users can use voice calls as a secondary form of authentication, to verify their identity, during self-service password reset (**SSPR**) or Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication. With phone call verification, an automated voice call is made to the phone number registered by the user. To complete the sign-in process, the user is prompted to press # on their keypad. Voice calls are not supported as a primary form of authentication, in Microsoft Entra ID.

# OATH
OATH (Open Authentication) is an open standard that specifies how time-based, one-time password (TOTP) codes are generated. One-time password codes can be used to authenticate a user. OATH TOTP is implemented using either software or hardware to generate the codes.

- **Software OATH tokens** are typically applications. Microsoft Entra ID generates the secret key, or seed, that's input into the app and used to generate each OTP.

- **OATH TOTP hardware tokens** (supported in public preview) are small hardware devices that look like a key fob that displays a code that refreshes every 30 or 60 seconds. OATH TOTP hardware tokens typically come with a secret key, or seed, preprogrammed in the token. These keys and other information specific to each token must be input into Microsoft Entra ID and then activated for use by end-users.

OATH software and hardware tokens, are only supported as secondary forms of authentication in Microsoft Entra ID, to verify an identity during self-service password reset (SSPR) or Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication.
