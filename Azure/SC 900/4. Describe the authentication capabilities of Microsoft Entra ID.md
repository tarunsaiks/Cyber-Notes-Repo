Learn about the authentication capabilities of Microsoft Entra ID, including multifactor authentication, and how they improve security. You'll also learn about self-service password reset (SSPR) and the password protection and management capabilities.

# Introduction

Authentication is the process of verifying an identity to be legitimate. Passwords are commonly used to authenticate users, but there are better and more secure ways to authenticate.

In this module, you'll learn about the authentication capabilities of Microsoft Entra ID, multifactor authentication, and how it improves security. You'll also find out about the password protection and management capabilities of Microsoft Entra ID.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe the authentication methods of Microsoft Entra ID.
- Describe multifactor authentication in Microsoft Entra ID
- Describe the password protection and management capabilities of Microsoft Entra ID.

# Authentication Methods

One of the main features of an identity platform is to verify, or authenticate, credentials when a user signs in to a device, application, or service. Microsoft Entra ID offers different methods of authentication. 

1. Passwords
2. Phone
3. OAuth
4. Passwordless Authentication
5. Windows Hello for Business
6. FIDO2
7. Microsoft Authentication
8. Certificate-based Authentication
9. Primary and secondary authentication

## Passwords

Common authentication form, with many problems, if used with single-factor auth. 
If easy to remember -> easy for hackers to compromise the account.

The use of passwords should be supplemented or replaced with more secure authentication methods available in Microsoft Entra ID.

## Phone

Microsoft Entra ID supports two options for mobile-based authentication.
- SMS-based authentication
- Voice Call verification

### SMS based authentication
Short message service (SMS) used in mobile device text messaging can be used as a primary form of authentication. With SMS-based sign-in, users don't need to know a username and password to access applications and services. The user instead enters their registered mobile phone number, receives a text message with a verification code, and enters that in the sign-in interface.
