Microsoft Entra ID is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management solution.

# Introduction

Network boundary is not good enough to be relied upon. To allow employees, users, partners to collaborate securely, the approach towards identity shifts and becomes a network perimeter. Using identity provider helps to manage all aspects of identity security at one place.

# Entra ID

- Cloud based Identity and Access Management service.
- Internal resources like apps on corporate network and intranet and cloud apps are developed by organizations.
- External services like Office 365, Azure portal and any SaaS application used by organization.
- Microsoft Entra ID simplifies the way organizations manage authorization and access by providing a single identity system for their cloud and on-premises applications. 
- Microsoft Entra ID can be synchronized with your existing on-premises Active Directory, synchronized with other directory services, or used as a **standalone service**..

## Identity Secure Score

- Percentage value that indicates how aligned the organization's identity management is with Microsoft's best practices.
- Basic terminologies to be kept in mind:
	- Tenant
	- Directory
	- Multi-Tenant

### Tenant

An instance in Entra ID, contains information about a single organization with organizational objects like users, groups, devices and application registrations.

Tenant also contains access and compliance policies for resources such as applications registered in the directory with each tenant with unique ID and a domain name and serves as a security administrative boundary allowing organizations to manage and control access to resources, applications, devices and services.

### Directory

Logical container within Microsoft Tenant that holds and organizes the resources and objects related to IAM including users, groups, devices, applications and other directory objects.

Database or catalog of identities and resources associated with an organization's tenant

### Multi Tenant

an organization might have more than one instance of Microsoft Entra ID, this could be due to multiple subsidiaries or business units that operate independently.

## Who uses Entra ID?

- Mainly used by IT admins to control access to corporate apps and resources based on business requirements.
- It provides powerful tools to automatically protect user identities and credentials to meet an governance requirements with access controls.
- Entra ID is used by developers to add SSO to their apps, Entra ID provides API's to allow personalized apps using existing organization data.

## Workload Identities
#### Applications and service principals

A service principal is essentially, **an identity for an application**. For an application to delegate its identity and access functions to Microsoft Entra ID, the application must first be registered with Microsoft Entra ID to enable its integration. Once an application is registered, a service principal is created in each Microsoft Entra tenant where the application is used. The service principal enables core features such as authentication and authorization of the application to resources that are secured by the Microsoft Entra tenant.

For the service principals to be able to access resources secured by the Microsoft Entra tenant, application developers must manage and protect the credentials. If not done correctly, this can introduce security vulnerabilities. Managed identities help off-load that responsibility from the developer.

#### Managed identities

**Managed identities are a type of service principal that are automatically managed in Microsoft Entra ID** and eliminate the need for developers to manage credentials. Managed identities provide an identity for applications to use when connecting to Azure resources that support Microsoft Entra authentication and can be used without any extra cost.

[![A Diagram that shows how a developer may use managed identities to get access to resources from their code without managing credentials.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/explore-basic-services-identity-types/media/managed-identities-inline.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/explore-basic-services-identity-types/media/managed-identities-expanded.png#lightbox)

For a list of Azure Services that support managed identities, refer to the Learn more section of the Summary and resources unit.

There are two types of managed identities: system-assigned and user-assigned.

- **System-assigned**. Some Azure resources, such as virtual machines, allow you to enable a managed identity directly on the resource. When you enable a system-assigned managed identity an identity is created in Microsoft Entra **that's tied to the lifecycle of that Azure resource**. Because the identity is tied to the lifecycle of that Azure resource when the resource is deleted, Azure automatically deletes the identity for you. An example where you may find a system-assigned identity is when a workload is contained within a single Azure resource, such as an application that runs on a single virtual machine.
    
- **User-assigned**. You may also create a managed identity as a standalone Azure resource. Once you create a user-assigned managed identity, you can assign it to one or more instances of an Azure service. For example, a user-assigned managed identity can be assigned to multiple VMs. With user-assigned managed identities, the identity is managed separately from the resources that use it. **Deleting the resources that use the user-assigned managed identity doesn't delete the identity**. The user-assigned managed identity must be explicitly deleted. This is useful in a scenario where you may have multiple VMs that all have the same set of permissions but may get recycled frequently. Deleting any of the VMs doesn’t impact the user-assigned managed identity. Similarly, you can create a new VM and assign it the existing user-assigned managed identity.

## User

User identities represent people such as employees and external users (customers, consultants, vendors, and partners). In Microsoft Entra ID, user identities are characterized by how they authenticate and the user type property.

How the user authenticates is asked relative to the host organization’s Microsoft Entra tenant and can be internal or external. Internal - user has account in organizations Microsoft tenant; External - uses external Microsoft Entra account that belongs to other organization or social network identity.
![](../../Pasted%20image%2020250216170501.png)

- Internal member: These users are typically considered employees of your organization. The user authenticates internally via their organization’s Microsoft Entra ID, and the user object created in the resource Microsoft Entra directory has a UserType of Member.
- External guest: External users or guests, including consultants, vendors, and partners, typically fall into this category. The user authenticates using an external Microsoft Entra account or an external identity provider (such as a social identity). The user object created in the resource Microsoft Entra directory has a UserType of Guest, giving them limited, guest-level permissions.
- External member: This scenario is common in organizations consisting of multiple tenants. Consider the scenario where the Contoso Microsoft Entra tenant and the Fabrikam Microsoft Entra tenant are tenants within one large organization. Users from the Contoso tenant need member level access to resources in Fabrikam. In this scenario, Contoso users are configured in the Fabrikam Microsoft Entra directory such that they authenticate with their Contoso account, which is external to Fabrikam, but have a UserType of Member to enable member-level access to Fabrikam’s organizational resources.
- Internal guest: This scenario exists when organizations who collaborate with distributors, suppliers, and vendors set up internal Microsoft Entra accounts for these users but designate them as guests by setting the user object UserType to Guest. As a guest, they have reduced permissions in the directory. This is considered a legacy scenario as it is now more common to use B2B collaboration. With B2B collaboration users can use their own credentials, allowing their external identity provider to manage authentication and their account lifecycle.

External guests and external members are business-to-business (B2B) collaboration users that fall under the category of external identities in Microsoft Entra ID and is described in more detail in the subsequent unit.

## Device

A device is a piece of hardware, such as mobile devices, laptops, servers, or printers. A device identity gives administrators information they can use when making access or configuration decisions. Device identities can be set up in different ways in Microsoft Entra ID.

- **Microsoft Entra registered devices**. The goal of Microsoft Entra registered devices is to provide users with support for bring your own device (BYOD) or mobile device scenarios. In these scenarios, a user can access your organization’s resources using a personal device. Microsoft Entra registered devices register to Microsoft Entra ID without requiring an organizational account to sign in to the device.
- **Microsoft Entra joined**. A Microsoft Entra joined device is a device joined to Microsoft Entra ID through an organizational account, which is then used to sign in to the device. Microsoft Entra joined devices are generally owned by the organization.
- **Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices**. Organizations with existing on-premises Active Directory implementations can benefit from the functionality provided by Microsoft Entra ID by implementing Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices. These devices are joined to your on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID requiring organizational account to sign in to the device.

Registering and joining devices to Microsoft Entra ID gives users Single Sign-on (SSO) to cloud-based resources. Additionally, devices that are Microsoft Entra joined benefit from the SSO experience to resources and applications that rely on on-premises Active Directory.

IT admins can use tools like Microsoft Intune, a cloud-based service that focuses on mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM), to control how an organization’s devices are used. For more information, see [Microsoft Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune).

## Groups

In Microsoft Entra ID, if you have several identities with the same access needs, you can create a group. You use groups to give access permissions to all members of the group, instead of having to assign access rights individually. Limiting access to Microsoft Entra resources to only those identities who need access is one of the core security principles of Zero Trust.

There are two group types:

- Security: A security group is the most common type of group and it's used to manage user and device access to shared resources. For example, you may create a security group for a specific security policy such as Self-service password reset or for use with a conditional access policy to require MFA. Members of a security group can include users (including external users), devices, other groups, and service principals. Creating security groups requires a Microsoft Entra administrator role.
    
- Microsoft 365: A Microsoft 365 group, which is also often referred to as a distribution group, is used for grouping users according to collaboration needs. For example, you can give members of the group access to a shared mailbox, calendar, files SharePoint sites, and more. Members of a Microsoft 365 group can only include users, including users outside of your organization. Because Microsoft 365 groups are intended for collaboration, the default is to allow users to create Microsoft 365 groups, so you don’t need an administrator role.
    

Groups can be configured to allow members to be assigned, that is manually selected, or they can be configured for dynamic membership. Dynamic membership uses rules to automatically add and remove identities.

# Hybrid Identity
While there's no denying the rapid pace at which organizations are moving their workloads to the cloud, many businesses, and corporations are still a mixture of on-premises and cloud applications. Regardless of where an application is hosted, users expect and require easy access. As such, there's need to have a single identity across these various applications.

Microsoft’s identity solutions span on-premises and cloud-based capabilities. These solutions create a common identity for authentication and authorization to all resources, regardless of location. We call this hybrid identity.

Hybrid identity is accomplished through provisioning and synchronization.

- Inter-directory provisioning is provisioning an identity between two different directory services systems. For a hybrid environment, the most common scenario for inter-directory provisioning is when a user already in Active Directory is provisioned into Microsoft Entra ID.
- Synchronization is responsible for making sure identity information for your on-premises users and groups is matching the cloud.

One of the available methods for accomplishing inter-directory provisioning and synchronization is through Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync. Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync is designed to meet and accomplish your hybrid identity goals for the provisioning and synchronization of users, groups, and contacts to Microsoft Entra ID. It accomplishes this by using the Microsoft Entra cloud provisioning agent. The agent provides a lightweight inter-directory provisioning experience that acts as a bridge between Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory. An organization only needs to deploy the agent in their on-premises or IaaS-hosted environment. The provisioning configuration is stored in Microsoft Entra ID and managed as part of the service.

[![Illustration of a hybrid identity on an on-premises Active Directory with Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync pointing to the cloud-based Microsoft Entra ID.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/explore-basic-services-identity-types/media/entra-cloud-sync-inline.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/explore-basic-services-identity-types/media/entra-cloud-sync-inline.png#lightbox)

The Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync provisioning agent uses the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification with Microsoft Entra ID to provision and deprovision users and groups. The SCIM specification is a standard that is used to automate the exchanging of user or group identity information between identity domains such as Microsoft Entra ID and is becoming the de facto standard for provisioning.

# External Identities
Today’s world is about collaboration, working with people both inside and outside of your organization. That means you'll sometimes need to provide access to your organization’s applications or data to external users.

Microsoft Entra External ID combines powerful solutions for working with people outside of your organization. With External ID capabilities, you can allow external identities to securely access your apps and resources. Whether you’re working with external partners, consumers, or business customers, users can bring their own identities. These identities can range from corporate or government-issued accounts to social identity providers like Google or Facebook.

![Diagram showing elements of Microsoft External ID. On the left, it shows Consumers business customers, and guests. On the right, it shows business apps, consumer apps, and on-premises apps. In the center, is a circle showing secure user access, seamless experience, and secure app development.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/explore-basic-services-identity-types/media/external-identities-overview.png)

Microsoft Entra External ID addresses the scenarios that are encountered when it comes to working with external users.

- Collaborate with business guests
- Secure your apps for consumers and business customers

Also, each of these scenarios suggests a different approach for how an organization configures their Microsoft Entra ID tenant.

There are two ways to configure a tenant, depending on how the organization intends to use the tenant and the resources they want to manage:

- A workforce tenant configuration is for your employees, internal business apps, and other organizational resources. You can invite external business partners and guests to your workforce tenant.
- An external tenant configuration is used exclusively for External ID scenarios where you want to publish apps to consumers or business customers.

![Diagram showing a representation of the two external ID scenarios and the corresponding tenant type. Collaboration with business guests uses a workforce tenant configuration. External facing apps use an external tenant configuration.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/explore-basic-services-identity-types/media/external-id-tenant-configurations.png)

### Collaborate with business guests

If you want to enable your employees to collaborate with business partners and guests, use External ID for B2B collaboration.

External ID B2B collaboration allows your workforce to collaborate with external business partners.

Using your workforce tenant, you can use B2B collaboration to share your company's applications and services with guests, while maintaining control over your own corporate data. You can invite anyone to sign in to your Microsoft Entra organization using their own credentials so they can access the apps and resources you want to share with them.

Use B2B collaboration when you need to let business guests access your Office 365 apps, software-as-a-service (SaaS) apps, and line-of-business applications. There are no credentials associated with business guests. Instead, they authenticate with their home organization or identity provider, and then your organization checks the user’s eligibility for guest collaboration.

![Diagram showing a representation of B2B collaboration.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/explore-basic-services-identity-types/media/b2b-collaboration-overview.png)

### Secure your apps for consumers and business customers

If you’re an organization or a developer creating consumer apps, use External ID to quickly add authentication and customer identity and access management (CIAM) to your application.

Microsoft Entra External ID includes Microsoft's customer identity and access management (CIAM) solution that includes features like self-service registration, personalized sign-in experiences including single sign-on (SSO) with social and enterprise identities, and customer account management. Because these CIAM capabilities are built into Microsoft Entra ID, you also benefit from platform features like enhanced security, compliance, and scalability.
