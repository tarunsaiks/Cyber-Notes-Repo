# Describe Security and Compliance Concepts

## Introduction
- More business data accessed from various locations unlike traditional corporate network and compliance has been a concern.
- So, naturally organizations want to protect their data and be compliant to industry and regulatory requirements and ensure privacy.
- In this part, i was told i will be learning about shared responsibility model, defense in depth, concepts of encryption and Zero Trust model. (EXCITINNNGGGG!!)

## Shared Responsibility Model
This is pretty much it.

To be brief and precise:
1. Organizations using On-Prem model manage and are responsible for everything
2. In cloud, we have 3 service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), so responsibilities differ.
3. And that's how it is, Now, isn't that easy!!
