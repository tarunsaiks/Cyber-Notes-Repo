# Describe Security and Compliance Concepts

## Introduction
- More business data accessed from various locations unlike traditional corporate network and compliance has been a concern.
- So, naturally organizations want to protect their data and be compliant to industry and regulatory requirements and ensure privacy.
- In this part, i was told i will be learning about shared responsibility model, defense in depth, concepts of encryption and Zero Trust model. (EXCITINNNGGGG!!)

## Shared Responsibility Model
This is pretty much it.

To be brief and precise:
1. Organizations using On-Prem model manage and are responsible for everything
2. In cloud, we have 3 service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), so security and responsibilities differ.
3. And that's how it is, Now, isn't that easy!!

**IaaS** -  the cloud customer has responsibility for software components running on that computing infrastructure such as **operating systems, network controls, applications, and protecting data**.

**PaaS** -  PaaS provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications. The goal of PaaS is to help you **create an application quickly** without managing the underlying infrastructure. The cloud provider manages the **hardware and operating systems**, and the customer is responsible for applications and data.

In summary, responsibilities always retained by the customer organization include:
- Information and data
- Devices (mobile and PCs)
- Accounts and identities

## Defense in Depth
- Multi layered security approach, rather than single perimeter.
- helps by slow the advance of an attack.
- Each layer provides protection, so, if one is breached, the other layers prevent attacker to gaining access or compromising CIA.

#### Layers:
Example layers of security might include:

- **Physical** security such as limiting access to a datacenter to only authorized personnel.
- **Identity and access** security controls, such as multifactor authentication or condition-based access, to control access to infrastructure and change control.
- **Perimeter** security of your corporate network includes distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection to filter large-scale attacks before they can cause a denial of service for users.
- **Network** security, such as network segmentation and network access controls, to limit communication between resources.
- **Compute** layer security such as securing access to virtual machines either on-premises or in the cloud by closing certain ports.
- **Application** layer security to ensure applications are secure and free of security vulnerabilities.
- **Data** layer security including controls to manage access to business and customer data and encryption to protect data.

## CIA
The goal of using Defense in Depth is to ensure CIA, by implementing different mechanisms (technologies, processes and trainings) as part of cybersecurity strategy.

C - Confidentiality - to keep sensitive info (customer info, passwords, financial data) encrypted and confidential. Most visible part of security.
I - Integrity - To keep the messages and data correct. Ensure the data is not changed by unknown actors and the information is correct.
A - Availability - To make sure the data and services to those who need it is available as per business needs.

## Zero Trust Model
- Assumes everything is open and untrusted (hence, Zero Trust), be it behind the firewall.
- TRUST NO ONE, BUT VERIFY EVERYTHING.

This means that we no longer assume that a password is sufficient to validate a user but add multi-factor authentication to provide additional checks. 

Instead of granting access to all devices on the corporate network, users are allowed access only to the specific applications or data that they need.
