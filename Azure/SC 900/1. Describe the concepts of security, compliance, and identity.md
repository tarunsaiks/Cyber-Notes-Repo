# Describe Security and Compliance Concepts

## Introduction
- More business data accessed from various locations unlike traditional corporate network and compliance has been a concern.
- So, naturally organizations want to protect their data and be compliant to industry and regulatory requirements and ensure privacy.
- In this part, i was told i will be learning about shared responsibility model, defense in depth, concepts of encryption and Zero Trust model. (EXCITINNNGGGG!!)

## Shared Responsibility Model
This is pretty much it.
![](../../Pasted%20image%2020250210185126.png)
To be brief and precise:
1. Organizations using On-Prem model manage and are responsible for everything
2. In cloud, we have 3 service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), so security and responsibilities differ.
3. And that's how it is, Now, isn't that easy!!


**IaaS** -  the cloud customer has responsibility for software components running on that computing infrastructure such as **operating systems, network controls, applications, and protecting data**.

**PaaS** -  PaaS provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications. The goal of PaaS is to help you **create an application quickly** without managing the underlying infrastructure. The cloud provider manages the **hardware and operating systems**, and the customer is responsible for applications and data.

In summary, responsibilities always retained by the customer organization include:
- Information and data
- Devices (mobile and PCs)
- Accounts and identities

## Defense in Depth
- Multi layered security approach, rather than single perimeter.
- helps by slow the advance of an attack.
- Each layer provides protection, so, if one is breached, the other layers prevent attacker to gaining access or compromising CIA.

#### Layers:
Example layers of security might include:

- **Physical** security such as limiting access to a datacenter to only authorized personnel.
- **Identity and access** security controls, such as multifactor authentication or condition-based access, to control access to infrastructure and change control.
- **Perimeter** security of your corporate network includes distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection to filter large-scale attacks before they can cause a denial of service for users.
- **Network** security, such as network segmentation and network access controls, to limit communication between resources.
- **Compute** layer security such as securing access to virtual machines either on-premises or in the cloud by closing certain ports.
- **Application** layer security to ensure applications are secure and free of security vulnerabilities.
- **Data** layer security including controls to manage access to business and customer data and encryption to protect data.

## CIA
The goal of using Defense in Depth is to ensure CIA, by implementing different mechanisms (technologies, processes and trainings) as part of cybersecurity strategy.

C - Confidentiality - to keep sensitive info (customer info, passwords, financial data) encrypted and confidential. Most visible part of security.
I - Integrity - To keep the messages and data correct. Ensure the data is not changed by unknown actors and the information is correct.
A - Availability - To make sure the data and services to those who need it is available as per business needs.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Zero Trust Model
- Assumes everything is open and untrusted (hence, Zero Trust), be it behind the firewall.
- TRUST NO ONE, BUT VERIFY EVERYTHING.

This means that we no longer assume that a password is sufficient to validate a user but add multi-factor authentication to provide additional checks. 

Instead of granting access to all devices on the corporate network, users are allowed access only to the specific applications or data that they need.

### Zero Trust guiding principles

The Zero Trust model has three principles which guide and underpin how security is implemented. These are: verify explicitly, least privilege access, and assume breach.

- **Verify explicitly**. Always authenticate and authorize based on the available data points, including user identity, location, device, service or workload, data classification, and anomalies.
- **Least privileged access**. Limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection to protect both data and productivity.
- **Assume breach**. Segment access by network, user, devices, and application. Use encryption to protect data, and use analytics to get visibility, detect threats, and improve your security.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
#### Six foundational pillars

In the Zero Trust model, all elements work together to provide end-to-end security. These six elements are the foundational pillars of the Zero Trust model:

- **Identities** may be users, services, or devices. When an identity attempts to access a resource, it must be verified with strong authentication, and follow least privilege access principles.
- **Devices** create a large attack surface as data flows from devices to on-premises workloads and the cloud. Monitoring devices for health and compliance is an important aspect of security.
- **Applications** are the way that data is consumed. This includes discovering all applications being used, sometimes called Shadow IT because not all applications are managed centrally. This pillar also includes managing permissions and access.
- **Data** should be classified, labeled, and encrypted based on its attributes. Security efforts are ultimately about protecting data, and ensuring it remains safe when it leaves devices, applications, infrastructure, and networks that the organization controls.
- **Infrastructure**, whether on-premises or cloud based, represents a threat vector. To improve security, you assess for version, configuration, and JIT access, and use telemetry to detect attacks and anomalies. This allows you to automatically block or flag risky behavior and take protective actions.
- **Networks** should be segmented, including deeper in-network micro segmentation. Also, real-time threat protection, end-to-end encryption, monitoring, and analytics should be employed.

## Encryption and Hashing
One way to mitigate against common cybersecurity threats is to encrypt sensitive or valuable data. Two types of encryption. Symmetric (same key) and Asymmetric (Public and Private key).
![](../../Pasted%20image%2020250210200208.png)


### Encryption for data at rest

Data at rest is the data that's stored on a physical device, such as a server. It may be stored in a database or a storage account but, regardless of where it's stored, encryption of data at rest ensures the data is unreadable without the keys and secrets needed to decrypt it. - ALL DATA

If an attacker obtained a hard drive with encrypted data and didn't have access to the encryption keys, they would be unable to read the data.

### Encryption for data in transit

Data in transit is the data moving from one location to another, such as across the internet or through a private network. Secure transfer can be handled by several different layers. It could be done by encrypting the data at the application layer before sending it over a network. 

HTTPS is an example of encryption in transit.

Encrypting data in transit protects it from outside observers and provides a mechanism to transmit data while limiting the risk of exposure. Reduces On-Path attacks impact.

### Encryption for data in use

A common use case for encryption of data in use involves securing data in nonpersistent storage, such as RAM or CPU caches. This can be achieved through technologies that create an **enclave** (think of this as a secured lockbox) that protects the data and keeps data encrypted while the CPU processes the data.

## Hashing

Hashing uses an algorithm to convert text to a _unique_ fixed-length value called a hash. Each time the same text is hashed using the same algorithm, the same hash value is produced. That hash can then be used as a unique identifier of its associated data.

Hashing is different to encryption in that it doesn't use keys, and the hashed value isn't subsequently decrypted back to the original.

Hashing is often used to store passwords. 
- When a user enters their password, the same algorithm that created the stored hash creates a hash of the entered password. 
- This is compared to the stored hashed version of the password. If they match, the user has entered their password correctly. 
- This is more secure than storing plain text passwords, but hashing algorithms are also known to hackers. Because hash functions are deterministic (the same input produces the same output), hackers can use brute-force dictionary attacks by hashing the passwords. 
- For every matched hash, they know the actual password. To mitigate this risk, passwords are often “salted”. This refers to adding a fixed-length random value to the input of hash functions to create unique hashes for same input.

## Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC)

![](../../Pasted%20image%2020250210200821.png)

### **Governance** 
- System of rules, practices and processes an organization uses to direct and control its overall activities. 
- These activities arise from external standards, obligations and expectations.
- For example, organizations establish rules and process that define the who, what, where, and when users and applications can access corporate resources and who has administrative privileges and for how long.
### Risk
- Process of identifying, assessing and responding to threats or events that can impact an organization. Both internal and external sources to risk.
- External risks - Pandemics, Natural disasters, political and economic conditions.
- Internal risks - Within Organization - sensitive data leak, Intellectual Property theft, fraud and insider trading.
### Compliance
- Refers to country, state, federal laws or multi-national regulations that a organization must be in compliance with/ to follow.
- These regulations define, what types of data must be protected, how long the data should be retained, what processes are required under legislation and what penalties will be issued upon failure to comply.
- security should be considered when building a compliance plan as effective security is frequently a compliance requirement. Compliance requires that legally mandated minimum standards are met, data security covers all the processes, procedures and technologies that define how you look after data and be in compliance.

#### Compliance related concepts:
- **Data Residency** - govern the physical locations where data can be stored and how and when it can be transferred, processed, or accessed internationally. Differs based on region and jurisdiction.
- **Data Sovereignty** - Concept that data like PII is subject to laws and regulations of the country/region in which it's physically collected, held or processed. This can add a layer of complexity when it comes to compliance because the same piece of data can be collected in one location, stored in another, and processed in still another; making it subject to laws from different countries/regions.
- **Data Privacy** - Providing notice and being transparent about the collection, processing, use, and sharing of personal data are fundamental principles of privacy laws and regulations. 


>[!tip] Personal Data
> Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. Privacy laws encompass any data that is directly linked or indirectly linkable back to a person. Organizations are subject to, and must operate consistent with, a multitude of laws, regulations, codes of conduct, industry-specific standards, and compliance standards governing data privacy.
