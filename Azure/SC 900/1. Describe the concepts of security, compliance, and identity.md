# Describe Security and Compliance Concepts

## Introduction
- More business data accessed from various locations unlike traditional corporate network and compliance has been a concern.
- So, naturally organizations want to protect their data and be compliant to industry and regulatory requirements and ensure privacy.
- In this part, i was told i will be learning about shared responsibility model, defense in depth, concepts of encryption and Zero Trust model. (EXCITINNNGGGG!!)

## Shared Responsibility Model
This is pretty much it.

To be brief and precise:
1. Organizations using On-Prem model manage and are responsible for everything
2. In cloud, we have 3 service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), so security and responsibilities differ.
3. And that's how it is, Now, isn't that easy!!

**IaaS** -  the cloud customer has responsibility for software components running on that computing infrastructure such as **operating systems, network controls, applications, and protecting data**.

**PaaS** -  PaaS provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications. The goal of PaaS is to help you **create an application quickly** without managing the underlying infrastructure. The cloud provider manages the **hardware and operating systems**, and the customer is responsible for applications and data.

In summary, responsibilities always retained by the customer organization include:
- Information and data
- Devices (mobile and PCs)
- Accounts and identities

## Defense in Depth
- Multi layered security approach, rather than single perimeter.
- helps by slow the advance of an attack.
- Each layer provides protection, so, if one is breached, the other layers prevent attacker to gaining access or compromising CIA.

#### Layers:
Example layers of security might include:

- **Physical** security such as limiting access to a datacenter to only authorized personnel.
- **Identity and access** security controls, such as multifactor authentication or condition-based access, to control access to infrastructure and change control.
- **Perimeter** security of your corporate network includes distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection to filter large-scale attacks before they can cause a denial of service for users.
- **Network** security, such as network segmentation and network access controls, to limit communication between resources.
- **Compute** layer security such as securing access to virtual machines either on-premises or in the cloud by closing certain ports.
- **Application** layer security to ensure applications are secure and free of security vulnerabilities.
- **Data** layer security including controls to manage access to business and customer data and encryption to protect data.

## CIA
The goal of using Defense in Depth is to ensure CIA, by implementing different mechanisms (technologies, processes and trainings) as part of cybersecurity strategy.

C - Confidentiality - to keep sensitive info (customer info, passwords, financial data) encrypted and confidential. Most visible part of security.
I - Integrity - To keep the messages and data correct. Ensure the data is not changed by unknown actors and the information is correct.
A - Availability - To make sure the data and services to those who need it is available as per business needs.

## Zero Trust Model
- Assumes everything is open and untrusted (hence, Zero Trust), be it behind the firewall.
- TRUST NO ONE, BUT VERIFY EVERYTHING.

This means that we no longer assume that a password is sufficient to validate a user but add multi-factor authentication to provide additional checks. 

Instead of granting access to all devices on the corporate network, users are allowed access only to the specific applications or data that they need.

### Zero Trust guiding principles

The Zero Trust model has three principles which guide and underpin how security is implemented. These are: verify explicitly, least privilege access, and assume breach.

- **Verify explicitly**. Always authenticate and authorize based on the available data points, including user identity, location, device, service or workload, data classification, and anomalies.
- **Least privileged access**. Limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection to protect both data and productivity.
- **Assume breach**. Segment access by network, user, devices, and application. Use encryption to protect data, and use analytics to get visibility, detect threats, and improve your security.

#### Six foundational pillars

In the Zero Trust model, all elements work together to provide end-to-end security. These six elements are the foundational pillars of the Zero Trust model:

- **Identities** may be users, services, or devices. When an identity attempts to access a resource, it must be verified with strong authentication, and follow least privilege access principles.
- **Devices** create a large attack surface as data flows from devices to on-premises workloads and the cloud. Monitoring devices for health and compliance is an important aspect of security.
- **Applications** are the way that data is consumed. This includes discovering all applications being used, sometimes called Shadow IT because not all applications are managed centrally. This pillar also includes managing permissions and access.
- **Data** should be classified, labeled, and encrypted based on its attributes. Security efforts are ultimately about protecting data, and ensuring it remains safe when it leaves devices, applications, infrastructure, and networks that the organization controls.
- **Infrastructure**, whether on-premises or cloud based, represents a threat vector. To improve security, you assess for version, configuration, and JIT access, and use telemetry to detect attacks and anomalies. This allows you to automatically block or flag risky behavior and take protective actions.
- **Networks** should be segmented, including deeper in-network micro segmentation. Also, real-time threat protection, end-to-end encryption, monitoring, and analytics should be employed.
